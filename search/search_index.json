From time to time the IP address that your ISP assigns changes and it's difficult to keep up. Fortunately, there is a solution: Dynamic DNS. The section below shows you how to set up an easy-to-remember domain name that follows your public IP address no matter when it changes. Secondly, how do you get into your home network? Your router has a firewall that is designed to keep the rest of the internet out of your network to protect you. The solution to that is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or \"tunnel\". Dynamic DNS There are two parts to a Dynamic DNS service: You have to register with a Dynamic DNS service provider and obtain a domain name that is not already taken by someone else. Something on your side of the network needs to propagate updates so that your chosen domain name remains in sync with your router's dynamically-allocated public IP address. Register with a Dynamic DNS service provider The first part is fairly simple and there are quite a few Dynamic DNS service providers including: DuckDNS.org NoIP.com You can find more service providers by Googling \"Dynamic DNS service\" . Some router vendors also provide their own built-in Dynamic DNS capabilities for registered customers so it's a good idea to check your router's capabilities before you plough ahead. Dynamic DNS propagation The \"something\" on your side of the network propagating WAN IP address changes can be either: your router; or a \"behind the router\" technique, typically a periodic job running on the same Raspberry Pi that is hosting IOTstack and WireGuard. If you have the choice, your router is to be preferred. That's because your router is usually the only device in your network that actually knows when its WAN IP address changes. A Dynamic DNS client running on your router will propagate changes immediately and will only transmit updates when necessary. More importantly, it will persist through network interruptions or Dynamic DNS service provider outages until it receives an acknowledgement that the update has been accepted. Nevertheless, your router may not support the Dynamic DNS service provider you wish to use, or may come with constraints that you find unsatisfactory so any behind-the-router technique is always a viable option, providing you understand its limitations. A behind-the-router technique usually relies on sending updates according to a schedule. An example is a cron job that runs every five minutes. That means any router WAN IP address changes won't be propagated until the next scheduled update. In the event of network interruptions or service provider outages, it may take some time before everything is back in sync. Moreover, given that WAN IP address changes are infrequent events, most scheduled updates will be sending information unnecessarily, contributing unnecessarily to server load. This seems to be a problem for DuckDNS which takes a beating because almost every person using it is sending an update bang-on five minutes. DuckDNS client IOTstack provides a solution for DuckDNS. The best approach to running it is: $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin $ cp ~/IOTstack/duck/duck.sh ~/.local/bin The reason for recommending that you make a copy of duck.sh is because the \"original\" is under Git control. If you change the \"original\", Git will keep telling you that the file has changed and it may block incoming updates from GitHub. Then edit ~/.local/bin/duck.sh to add your DuckDNS domain name(s) and token: DOMAINS = \"YOURS.duckdns.org\" DUCKDNS_TOKEN = \"YOUR_DUCKDNS_TOKEN\" For example: DOMAINS = \"downunda.duckdns.org\" DUCKDNS_TOKEN = \"8a38f294-b5b6-4249-b244-936e997c6c02\" Note: The DOMAINS= variable can be simplified to just \"YOURS\", with the .duckdns.org portion implied, as in: DOMAINS = \"downunda\" Once your credentials are in place, test the result by running: $ ~/.local/bin/duck.sh ddd, dd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss \u00b1zzzz - updating DuckDNS OK The timestamp is produced by the duck.sh script. The expected responses from the DuckDNS service are: \"OK\" - indicating success; or \"KO\" - indicating failure. Check your work if you get \"KO\" or any other errors. Next, assuming dig is installed on your Raspberry Pi ( sudo apt install dnsutils ), you can test propagation by sending a directed query to a DuckDNS name server. For example, assuming the domain name you registered was downunda.duckdns.org , you would query like this: $ dig @ns1.duckdns.org downunda.duckdns.org +short The expected result is the IP address of your router's WAN interface. It is a good idea to confirm that it is the same as you get from whatismyipaddress.com . A null result indicates failure so check your work. Remember, the Domain Name System is a distributed database. It takes time for changes to propagate. The response you get from directing a query to ns1.duckdns.org may not be the same as the response you get from any other DNS server. You often have to wait until cached records expire and a recursive query reaches the authoritative DuckDNS name-servers. Running the DuckDNS client automatically The recommended arrangement for keeping your Dynamic DNS service up-to-date is to invoke duck.sh from cron at five minute intervals. If you are new to cron , see these guides for more information about setting up and editing your crontab : raspberrytips.com pimylifeup.com A typical crontab will look like this: SHELL = /bin/bash HOME = /home/pi PATH = /home/pi/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin */5 * * * * duck.sh >/dev/null 2 > & 1 The first three lines construct the runtime environment correctly and should be at the start of any crontab . The last line means \"run duck.sh every five minutes\". See crontab.guru if you want to understand the syntax of the last line. When launched in the background by cron , the script supplied with IOTstack adds a random delay of up to one minute to try to reduce the \"hammering effect\" of a large number of users updating DuckDNS simultaneously. Standard output and standard error are redirected to /dev/null which is appropriate in this instance. When DuckDNS is working correctly (which is most of the time), the only output from the curl command is \"OK\". Logging that every five minutes would add wear and tear to SD cards for no real benefit. If you suspect DuckDNS is misbehaving, you can run the duck.sh command from a terminal session, in which case you will see all the curl output in the terminal window. If you wish to keep a log of duck.sh activity, the following will get the job done: Make a directory to hold log files: $ mkdir -p ~/Logs Edit the last line of the crontab like this: */5 * * * * duck.sh >>./Logs/duck.log 2 > & 1 Remember to prune the log from time to time. The generally-accepted approach is: $ cat /dev/null >~/Logs/duck.log Virtual Private Network WireGuard WireGuard is supplied as part of IOTstack. See WireGuard documentation . PiVPN pimylifeup.com has an excellent tutorial on how to install PiVPN In point 17 and 18 they mention using noip for their dynamic DNS. Here you can use the DuckDNS address if you created one. Don't forget you need to open the port 1194 on your firewall. Most people won't be able to VPN from inside their network so download OpenVPN client for your mobile phone and try to connect over mobile data. ( More info. ) Once you activate your VPN (from your phone/laptop/work computer) you will effectively be on your home network and you can access your devices as if you were on the wifi at home. I personally use the VPN any time I'm on public wifi, all your traffic is secure. Zerotier https://www.zerotier.com/ Zerotier is an alternative to PiVPN that doesn't require port forwarding on your router. It does however require registering for their free tier service here .

Backup The backup command can be executed from IOTstack's menu, or from a cronjob. Running backup To ensure that all your data is saved correctly, the stack should be brought down. This is mainly due to databases potentially being in a state that could cause data loss. There are 2 ways to run backups: * From the menu: Backup and Restore > Run backup * Running the following command: bash ./scripts/backup.sh The command that's run from the command line can also be executed from a cronjob: 0 2 * * * cd /home/pi/IOTstack && /bin/bash ./scripts/backup.sh The current directory of bash must be in IOTstack's directory, to ensure that it can find the relative paths of the files it's meant to back up. In the example above, it's assume that it's inside the pi user's home directory. Arguments ./scripts/backup.sh {TYPE=3} {USER=$(whoami)} * Types: * 1 = Backup with Date * A tarball file will be created that contains the date and time the backup was started, in the filename. * 2 = Rolling Date * A tarball file will be created that contains the day of the week (0-6) the backup was started, in the filename. * If a tarball already exists with the same name, it will be overwritten. * 3 = Both * User: This parameter only becomes active if run as root.

With rolling being in ./backups/rolling/ and date backups in ./backups/backup/ * Log files can also be found in the ./backups/logs/ directory. Examples: ./scripts/backup.sh ./scripts/backup.sh 3 Either of these will run both backups. ./scripts/backup.sh 2 This will only produce a backup in the rollowing folder. It will be called 'backup_XX.tar.gz' where XX is the current day of the week (as an int) sudo bash ./scripts/backup.sh 2 pi This will only produce a backup in the rollowing folder and change all the permissions to the 'pi' user. Restore There are 2 ways to run a restore: * From the menu: Backup and Restore > Restore from backup * Running the following command: bash ./scripts/restore.sh Important : The restore script assumes that the IOTstack directory is fresh, as if it was just cloned. If it is not fresh, errors may occur, or your data may not correctly be restored even if no errors are apparent. Note : It is suggested that you test that your backups can be restored after initially setting up, and anytime you add or remove a service. Major updates to services can also break backups. Arguments ./scripts/restore.sh {FILENAME=backup.tar.gz} {noask} The restore script takes 2 arguments: * Filename: The name of the backup file. The file must be present in the ./backups/ directory, or a subfolder in it. That means it should be moved from ./backups/backup to ./backups/ , or that you need to specify the backup portion of the directory (see examples) * NoAsk: If a second parameter is present, is acts as setting the no ask flag to true. Pre and post script hooks The script checks if there are any pre and post back up hooks to execute commands. Both of these files will be included in the backup, and have also been added to the .gitignore file, so that they will not be touched when IOTstack updates. Prebackup script hook The prebackup hook script is executed before any compression happens and before anything is written to the temporary backup manifest file ( ./.tmp/backup-list_{{NAME}}.txt ). It can be used to prepare any services (such as databases that IOTstack isn't aware of) for backing up. To use it, simple create a ./pre_backup.sh file in IOTstack's main directory. It will be executed next time a backup runs. Postbackup script hook The postbackup hook script is executed after the tarball file has been written to disk, and before the final backup log information is written to disk. To use it, simple create a ./post_backup.sh file in IOTstack's main directory. It will be executed after the next time a backup runs. Post restore script hook The post restore hook script is executed after all files have been extracted and written to disk. It can be used to apply permissions that your custom services may require.

This will require that your service have a working options menu. Keep in mind that updating strings in a service's yaml config isn't limited to passwords. A word of caution Many services often set a password on their initial spin up and store it internally. That means if if the password is changed by the menu afterwards, it may not be reflected in the service. By default the password specified in the documentation should be used, unless the user specifically selected to use a randomly generated one. In the future, the feature to specify a password manually may be added in, much like how ports can be customised. A basic example Inside the service's service.yml file, a special string can be added in for the build script to find and replace. Commonly the string is %randomPassword% , but technically any string can be used. The same string can be used multiple times for the same password to be used multiple times, and/or multiple difference strings can be used for multiple passwords. mariadb: image: linuxserver/mariadb container_name: mariadb environment: - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=%randomAdminPassword% - MYSQL_DATABASE=default - MYSQL_USER=mariadbuser - MYSQL_PASSWORD=%randomPassword% These strings will be updated during the Prebuild Hook stage when building. The code to make this happen is shown below. Code commonly used to update passwords This code can basically be copy-pasted into your service's build.py file. You are welcome to expand upon it if required.

How to define a new service A service only requires 2 files: * service.yml - Contains data for docker-compose * build.py - Contains logic that the menu system uses. A basic service Inside the service.yml is where the service data for docker-compose is housed, for example: adminer: container_name: adminer image: adminer restart: unless-stopped ports: - \"9080:8080\" It is important that the service name match the directory that it's in - that means that the adminer service must be placed into a folder called adminer inside the ./.templates directory.

Create a file called compose-override.yml in the main directory, and place your modifications into it. These changes will be merged into the docker-compose.yml file next time you run the build script. The compose-override.yml file has been added to the .gitignore file, so it shouldn't be touched when upgrading IOTstack. It has been added to the backup script, and so will be included when you back up and restore IOTstack. Always test your backups though! New versions of IOTstack may break previous builds. How it works After the build process has been completed, a temporary docker compose file is created in the tmp directory. The script then checks if compose-override.yml exists: If it exists, then continue to step 3 If it does not exist, copy the temporary docker compose file to the main directory and rename it to docker-compose.yml . Using the yaml_merge.py script, merge both the compose-override.yml and the temporary docker compose file together; Using the temporary file as the default values and interating through each level of the yaml structure, check to see if the compose-override.yml has a value set. Output the final file to the main directory, calling it docker-compose.yml . A word of caution If you specify an override for a service, and then rebuild the docker-compose.yml file, but deselect the service from the list, then the YAML merging will still produce that override. For example, lets say NodeRed was selected to have have the following override specified in compose-override.yml : services: nodered: restart: always When rebuilding the menu, ensure to have NodeRed service always included because if it's no longer included, the only values showing in the final docker-compose.yml file for NodeRed will be the restart key and its value. Docker Compose will error with the following message: Service nodered has neither an image nor a build context specified. At least one must be provided. When attempting to bring the services up with docker-compose up -d . Either remove the override for NodeRed in compose-override.yml and rebuild the stack, or ensure that NodeRed is built with the stack to fix this. Examples Overriding default settings Lets assume you put the following into the compose-override.yml file: services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 Normally the mosquitto service would be built like this inside the docker-compose.yml file: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Take special note of the ports list. If you run the build script with the compose-override.yml file in place, and open up the final docker-compose.yml file, you will notice that the port list have been replaced with the ones you specified in the compose-override.yml file. version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Do note that it will replace the entire list, if you were to specify services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 Then the final output will be: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1996:1996 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Using env files instead of docker-compose variables If you need or prefer to use *.env files for docker-compose environment variables in a separate file instead of using overrides, you can do so like this: services: grafana: env_file: - ./services/grafana/grafana.env environment: This will remove the default environment variables set in the template, and tell docker-compose to use the variables specified in your file. It is not mandatory that the .env file be placed in the service's service directory, but is strongly suggested. Keep in mind the PostBuild Script functionality to automatically copy your .env files into their directories on successful build if you need to. Adding custom services Custom services can be added in a similar way to overriding default settings for standard services. Lets add a Minecraft and rcon server to IOTstack. Firstly, put the following into compose-override.yml : services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 minecraft: image: itzg/minecraft-server ports: - \"25565:25565\" volumes: - \"./volumes/minecraft:/data\" environment: EULA: \"TRUE\" TYPE: \"PAPER\" ENABLE_RCON: \"true\" RCON_PASSWORD: \"PASSWORD\" RCON_PORT: 28016 VERSION: \"1.15.2\" REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: \"TRUE\" ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: \"CFG_\" CFG_DB_HOST: \"http://localhost:3306\" CFG_DB_NAME: \"IOTstack Minecraft\" CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: \"/run/secrets/db_password\" restart: unless-stopped rcon: image: itzg/rcon ports: - \"4326:4326\" - \"4327:4327\" volumes: - \"./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db\" secrets: db_password: file: ./db_password Then create the service directory that the new instance will use to store persistant data: mkdir -p ./volumes/minecraft and mkdir -p ./volumes/rcon_data Obviously you will need to give correct folder names depending on the volumes you specify for your custom services. If your new service doesn't require persistant storage, then you can skip this step. Then simply run the ./menu.sh command, and rebuild the stack with what ever services you had before. Using the Mosquitto example above, the final docker-compose.yml file will look like: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: '1883' volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl minecraft: image: itzg/minecraft-server ports: - 25565:25565 volumes: - ./volumes/minecraft:/data environment: EULA: 'TRUE' TYPE: PAPER ENABLE_RCON: 'true' RCON_PASSWORD: PASSWORD RCON_PORT: 28016 VERSION: 1.15.2 REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: 'TRUE' ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: CFG_ CFG_DB_HOST: http://localhost:3306 CFG_DB_NAME: IOTstack Minecraft CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password restart: unless-stopped rcon: image: itzg/rcon ports: - 4326:4326 - 4327:4327 volumes: - ./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db secrets: db_password: file: ./db_password Do note that the order of the YAML keys is not guaranteed.","title":"Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack"},{"location":"Custom/#custom-services-and-overriding-default-settings-for-iotstack","text":"You can specify modifcations to the docker-compose.yml file, including your own networks and custom containers/services.

Docker, OpenHAB, HASSIO, NextCloud) assumptions IOTstack makes the following assumptions: Your hardware is a Raspberry Pi (typically a 3B+ or 4B) It has a reasonably-recent version of 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS (aka \"Raspbian\") installed which has been kept up-to-date with: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y You are logged-in as the user \"pi\" User \"pi\" has the user ID 1000 The home directory for user \"pi\" is /home/pi/ IOTstack is installed at /home/pi/IOTstack (with that exact spelling). The first five assumptions are Raspberry Pi defaults on a clean installation. The sixth is what you get if you follow these instructions faithfully. Please don't read these assumptions as saying that IOTstack will not run on other hardware, other operating systems, or as a different user. It is just that IOTstack gets most of its testing under these conditions. The further you get from these implicit assumptions, the more your mileage may vary. other platforms Users have reported success on other platforms, including: Orange Pi WinPlus new installation automatic (recommended) Install curl : $ sudo apt install -y curl Run the following command: $ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack/master/install.sh | bash Run the menu and choose your containers: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d manual Install git : $ sudo apt install -y git Clone IOTstack: If you want \"new menu\": $ git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack If you prefer \"old menu\": $ git clone -b old-menu https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack Run the menu and choose your containers: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Note: If you are running \"old menu\" for the first time, you will be guided to \"Install Docker\". That will end in a reboot, after which you should re-enter the menu and choose your containers. Bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d scripted If you prefer to automate your installations using scripts, see: Installing Docker for IOTstack . migrating from the old repo (gcgarner)? If you are still running on gcgarner/IOTstack and need to migrate to SensorsIot/IOTstack, see: Migrating IOTstack from gcgarner to SensorsIot . recommended system patches patch 1 \u2013 restrict DHCP Run the following commands: $ sudo bash -c '[ $(egrep -c \"^allowinterfaces eth*,wlan*\" /etc/dhcpcd.conf) -eq 0 ] && echo \"allowinterfaces eth*,wlan*\" >> /etc/dhcpcd.conf' $ sudo reboot See Issue 219 and Issue 253 for more information. patch 2 \u2013 update libseccomp2 If you don't have this patch in place, Docker images that are based on Alpine will fail if an image's maintainer updates to Alpine 3.13 . $ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138 $ echo \"deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free\" | sudo tee -a \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list\" $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install libseccomp2 -t buster-backports a word about the sudo command Many first-time users of IOTstack get into difficulty by misusing the sudo command. The problem is best understood by example. In the following, you would expect ~ (tilde) to expand to /home/pi . It does: $ echo ~/IOTstack /home/pi/IOTstack The command below sends the same echo command to bash for execution. This is what happens when you type the name of a shell script. You get a new instance of bash to run the script: $ bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /home/pi/IOTstack Same answer. Again, this is what you expect. But now try it with sudo on the front: $ sudo bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /root/IOTstack Different answer. It is different because sudo means \"become root, and then run the command\". The process of becoming root changes the home directory, and that changes the definition of ~ . Any script designed for working with IOTstack assumes ~ (or the equivalent $HOME variable) expands to /home/pi . That assumption is invalidated if the script is run by sudo . Of necessity, any script designed for working with IOTstack will have to invoke sudo inside the script when it is required . You do not need to second-guess the script's designer. Please try to minimise your use of sudo when you are working with IOTstack. Here are some rules of thumb: Is what you are about to run a script? If yes, check whether the script already contains sudo commands. Using menu.sh as the example: $ grep -c 'sudo' ~/IOTstack/menu.sh 28 There are numerous uses of sudo within menu.sh . That means the designer thought about when sudo was needed. Did the command you just executed work without sudo ? Note the emphasis on the past tense. If yes, then your work is done. If no, and the error suggests elevated privileges are necessary, then re-execute the last command like this: $ sudo !! It takes time, patience and practice to learn when sudo is actually needed. Over-using sudo out of habit, or because you were following a bad example you found on the web, is a very good way to find that you have created so many problems for yourself that will need to reinstall your IOTstack. Please err on the side of caution! the IOTstack menu The menu is used to install Docker and then build the docker-compose.yml file which is necessary for starting the stack. The menu is only an aid. It is a good idea to learn the docker and docker-compose commands if you plan on using Docker in the long run. menu item: Install Docker (old menu only) Please do not try to install docker and docker-compose via sudo apt install . There's more to it than that. Docker needs to be installed by menu.sh . The menu will prompt you to install docker if it detects that docker is not already installed. You can manually install it from within the Native Installs menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Native Installs\" Select \"Install Docker and Docker-Compose\" Follow the prompts. The process finishes by asking you to reboot. Do that! Note: New menu (master branch) automates this step. menu item: Build Stack docker-compose uses a docker-compose.yml file to configure all your services. The docker-compose.yml file is created by the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Build Stack\" Follow the on-screen prompts and select the containers you need. The best advice we can give is \"start small\". Limit yourself to the core containers you actually need (eg Mosquitto, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana, Portainer). You can always add more containers later. Some users have gone overboard with their initial selections and have run into what seem to be Raspberry Pi OS limitations. Key point: If you are running \"new menu\" (master branch) and you select Node-RED, you must press the right-arrow and choose at least one add-on node. If you skip this step, Node-RED will not build properly. Old menu forces you to choose add-on nodes for Node-RED. The process finishes by asking you to bring up the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d The first time you run up the stack docker will download all the images from DockerHub. How long this takes will depend on how many containers you selected and the speed of your internet connection. Some containers also need to be built locally. Node-RED is an example. Depending on the Node-RED nodes you select, building the image can also take a very long time. This is especially true if you select the SQLite node. Be patient (and ignore the huge number of warnings). menu item: Docker commands The commands in this menu execute shell scripts in the root of the project. other menu items The old and new menus differ in the options they offer. You should come back and explore them once your stack is built and running. switching menus At the time of writing, IOTstack supports three menus: \"Old Menu\" on the old-menu branch. This was inherited from gcgarner/IOTstack . \"New Menu\" on the master branch. This is the current menu. \"New New Menu\" on the experimental branch. This is under development. With a few precautions, you can switch between git branches as much as you like without breaking anything. The basic check you should perform is: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git status Check the results to see if any files are marked as \"modified\". For example: modified: .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile Key point: Files marked \"untracked\" do not matter. You only need to check for \"modified\" files because those have the potential to stop you from switching branches cleanly. The way to avoid potential problems is to move any modified files to one side and restore the unmodified original. For example: $ mv .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile.save $ git checkout -- .templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile When git status reports no more \"modified\" files, it is safe to switch your branch. current menu (master branch) $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout master $ ./menu.sh old menu (old-menu branch) $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout old-menu $ ./menu.sh experimental branch Switch to the experimental branch to try the latest and greatest features. $ cd ~/IOTstack/ $ git pull $ git checkout experimental $ ./menu.sh Notes: Please make sure you have a good backup before you start. The experimental branch may be broken, or may break your setup. Please report any issues. Remember: you can switch git branches as much as you like without breaking anything. simply launching the menu (any version) won't change anything providing you exit before letting the menu complete. running the menu to completion will change your docker-compose.yml and supporting structures in ~/IOTstack/services . running docker-compose up -d will change your running containers. The way back is to take down your stack, restore a backup, and bring up your stack again. useful commands: docker & docker-compose Handy rules: docker commands can be executed from anywhere, but docker-compose commands need to be executed from within ~/IOTstack starting your IOTstack To start the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Once the stack has been brought up, it will stay up until you take it down. This includes shutdowns and reboots of your Raspberry Pi. If you do not want the stack to start automatically after a reboot, you need to stop the stack before you issue the reboot command. logging journald errors If you get docker logging error like: Cannot create container for service [service name here]: unknown log opt 'max-file' for journald log driver Run the command: sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json change: \"log-driver\": \"journald\", to: \"log-driver\": \"json-file\", Logging limits were added to prevent Docker using up lots of RAM if log2ram is enabled, or SD cards being filled with log data and degraded from unnecessary IO. See Docker Logging configurations You can also turn logging off or set it to use another option for any service by using the IOTstack docker-compose-override.yml file mentioned at IOTstack/Custom . starting an individual container To start a particular container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb stopping your IOTstack Stopping aka \"downing\" the stack stops and deletes all containers, and removes the internal network: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down To stop the stack without removing containers, run: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop stopping an individual container stop can also be used to stop individual containers, like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop \u00abcontainer\u00bb This puts the container in a kind of suspended animation. You can resume the container with $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose start \u00abcontainer\u00bb There is no equivalent of down for a single container. It needs two commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose rm -f \u00abcontainer\u00bb To reactivate a container which has been stopped and removed: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb checking container status You can check the status of containers with: $ docker ps or $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose ps viewing container logs You can inspect the logs of most containers like this: $ docker logs \u00abcontainer\u00bb for example: $ docker logs nodered You can also follow a container's log as new entries are added by using the -f flag: $ docker logs -f nodered Terminate with a Control+C. Note that restarting a container will also terminate a followed log. restarting a container You can restart a container in several ways: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart \u00abcontainer\u00bb This kind of restart is the least-powerful form of restart. A good way to think of it is \"the container is only restarted, it is not rebuilt\". If you change a docker-compose.yml setting for a container and/or an environment variable file referenced by docker-compose.yml then a restart is usually not enough to bring the change into effect. You need to make docker-compose notice the change: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb This type of \"restart\" rebuilds the container. Alternatively, to force a container to rebuild (without changing either docker-compose.yml or an environment variable file): $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose rm -f \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb See also updating images built from Dockerfiles if you need to force docker-compose to notice a change to a Dockerfile. persistent data Docker allows a container's designer to map folders inside a container to a folder on your disk (SD, SSD, HD). This is done with the \"volumes\" key in docker-compose.yml . Consider the following snippet for Node-RED: volumes: - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data You read this as two paths, separated by a colon. The: external path is ./volumes/nodered/data internal path is /data In this context, the leading \".\" means \"the folder containing docker-compose.yml \", so the external path is actually: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data If a process running inside the container modifies any file or folder within: /data the change is mirrored outside the container at the same relative path within: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data The same is true in reverse. Any change made to any file or folder outside the container within: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data is mirrored at the same relative path inside the container at: /data deleting persistent data If you need a \"clean slate\" for a container, you can delete its volumes. Using InfluxDB as an example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop influxdb $ docker-compose rm -f influxdb $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb $ docker-compose up -d influxdb When docker-compose tries to bring up InfluxDB, it will notice this volume mapping in docker-compose.yml : volumes: - ./volumes/influxdb/data:/var/lib/influxdb and check to see whether ./volumes/influxdb/data is present. Finding it not there, it does the equivalent of: $ sudo mkdir -p ./volumes/influxdb/data When InfluxDB starts, it sees that the folder on right-hand-side of the volumes mapping ( /var/lib/influxdb ) is empty and initialises new databases. This is how most containers behave. There are exceptions so it's always a good idea to keep a backup. stack maintenance update Raspberry Pi OS You should keep your Raspberry Pi up-to-date. Despite the word \"container\" suggesting that containers are fully self-contained, they sometimes depend on operating system components (\"WireGuard\" is an example). $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y git pull Although the menu will generally do this for you, it does not hurt to keep your local copy of the IOTstack repository in sync with the master version on GitHub. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git pull container image updates There are two kinds of images used in IOTstack: Those not built using Dockerfiles (the majority) Those built using Dockerfiles (special cases) A Dockerfile is a set of instructions designed to customise an image before it is instantiated to become a running container. The easiest way to work out which type of image you are looking at is to inspect the container's service definition in your docker-compose.yml file. If the service definition contains the: image: keyword then the image is not built using a Dockerfile. build: keyword then the image is built using a Dockerfile. updating images not built from Dockerfiles If new versions of this type of image become available on DockerHub, your local IOTstack copies can be updated by a pull command: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune The pull downloads any new images. It does this without disrupting the running stack. The up -d notices any newly-downloaded images, builds new containers, and swaps old-for-new. There is barely any downtime for affected containers. updating images built from Dockerfiles Containers built using Dockerfiles have a two-step process: A base image is downloaded from from DockerHub; and then The Dockerfile \"runs\" to build a local image. Node-RED is a good example of a container built from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile defines some (or possibly all) of your add-on nodes, such as those needed for InfluxDB or Tasmota. There are two separate update situations that you need to consider: If your Dockerfile changes; or If a newer base image appears on DockerHub Node-RED also provides a good example of why your Dockerfile might change: if you decide to add or remove add-on nodes. Note: You can also add nodes to Node-RED using Manage Palette. when Dockerfile changes ( local image only) When your Dockerfile changes, you need to rebuild like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker system prune This only rebuilds the local image and, even then, only if docker-compose senses a material change to the Dockerfile. If you are trying to force the inclusion of a later version of an add-on node, you need to treat it like a DockerHub update . Key point: The base image is not affected by this type of update. Note: You can also use this type of build if you get an error after modifying Node-RED's environment: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d nodered when DockerHub updates ( base and local images) When a newer version of the base image appears on DockerHub, you need to rebuild like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker system prune $ docker system prune This causes DockerHub to be checked for the later version of the base image, downloading it as needed. Then, the Dockerfile is run to produce a new local image. The Dockerfile run happens even if a new base image was not downloaded in the previous step. deleting unused images As your system evolves and new images come down from DockerHub, you may find that more disk space is being occupied than you expected. Try running: $ docker system prune This recovers anything no longer in use. Sometimes multiple prune commands are needed (eg the first removes an old local image, the second removes the old base image). If you add a container via menu.sh and later remove it (either manually or via menu.sh ), the associated images(s) will probably persist. You can check which images are installed via: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE influxdb latest 1361b14bf545 5 days ago 264MB grafana/grafana latest b9dfd6bb8484 13 days ago 149MB iotstack_nodered latest 21d5a6b7b57b 2 weeks ago 540MB portainer/portainer-ce latest 5526251cc61f 5 weeks ago 163MB eclipse-mosquitto latest 4af162db6b4c 6 weeks ago 8.65MB nodered/node-red latest fa3bc6f20464 2 months ago 376MB portainer/portainer latest dbf28ba50432 2 months ago 62.5MB Both \"Portainer CE\" and \"Portainer\" are in that list. Assuming \"Portainer\" is no longer in use, it can be removed by using either its repository name or its Image ID. In other words, the following two commands are synonyms: $ docker rmi portainer/portainer $ docker rmi dbf28ba50432 In general, you can use the repository name to remove an image but the Image ID is sometimes needed. The most common situation where you are likely to need the Image ID is after an image has been updated on DockerHub and pulled down to your Raspberry Pi. You will find two containers with the same name. One will be tagged \"latest\" (the running version) while the other will be tagged \"\\<none>\" (the prior version). You use the Image ID to resolve the ambiguity. pinning to specific versions See container image updates to understand how to tell the difference between images that are used \"as is\" from DockerHub versus those that are built from local Dockerfiles. Note: You should always visit an image's DockerHub page before pinning to a specific version. This is the only way to be certain that you are choosing the appropriate version suffix. To pin an image to a specific version: If the image comes straight from DockerHub, you apply the pin in docker-compose.yml . For example, to pin Grafana to version 7.5.7, you change: grafana: container_name: grafana image: grafana/grafana:latest \u2026 to: grafana: container_name: grafana image: grafana/grafana:7.5.7 \u2026 To apply the change, \"up\" the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d grafana If the image is built using a local Dockerfile, you apply the pin in the Dockerfile. For example, to pin Mosquitto to version 1.6.15, edit ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile to change: # Download base image FROM eclipse-mosquitto:latest \u2026 to: # Download base image FROM eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.15 \u2026 To apply the change, \"up\" the container and pass the --build flag: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build mosquitto the nuclear option - use with caution You can use Git to delete all files and folders to return your folder to the freshly cloned state. Warning: YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR DATA . $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo git clean -d -x -f This is probably the only time you should ever need to use sudo in conjunction with git for IOTstack.

The problem is best understood by example. In the following, you would expect ~ (tilde) to expand to /home/pi . It does: $ echo ~/IOTstack /home/pi/IOTstack The command below sends the same echo command to bash for execution. This is what happens when you type the name of a shell script. You get a new instance of bash to run the script: $ bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /home/pi/IOTstack Same answer. Again, this is what you expect. But now try it with sudo on the front: $ sudo bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /root/IOTstack Different answer. It is different because sudo means \"become root, and then run the command\". The process of becoming root changes the home directory, and that changes the definition of ~ . Any script designed for working with IOTstack assumes ~ (or the equivalent $HOME variable) expands to /home/pi . That assumption is invalidated if the script is run by sudo . Of necessity, any script designed for working with IOTstack will have to invoke sudo inside the script when it is required . You do not need to second-guess the script's designer. Please try to minimise your use of sudo when you are working with IOTstack. Here are some rules of thumb: Is what you are about to run a script? If yes, check whether the script already contains sudo commands. Using menu.sh as the example: $ grep -c 'sudo' ~/IOTstack/menu.sh 28 There are numerous uses of sudo within menu.sh . That means the designer thought about when sudo was needed. Did the command you just executed work without sudo ? Note the emphasis on the past tense. If yes, then your work is done. If no, and the error suggests elevated privileges are necessary, then re-execute the last command like this: $ sudo !! It takes time, patience and practice to learn when sudo is actually needed.

Background Originally this script was written in bash. After a while it became obvious that bash wasn't well suited to dealing with all the different types of configuration files, and logic that goes with configuring everything. IOTstack needs to be accessible to all levels of programmers and tinkerers, not just ones experienced with Linux and bash. For this reason, it was rewritten in Python since the language syntax is easier to understand, and is more commonly used for scripting and programming than bash. Bash is still used in IOTstack where it makes sense to use it, but the menu system itself uses Python. The code it self while not being the most well structured or efficient, was intentionally made that way so that beginners and experienced programmers could contribute to the project. We are always open to improvements if you have suggestions. Menu Structure Each screen of the menu is its own Python script. You can find most of these in the ./scripts directory. When you select an item from the menu, and it changes screens, it actually dynamically loads and executes that Python script. It passes data as required by placing it into the global variable space so that both the child and the parent script can access it. Injecting and getting globals in a child script with open(childPythonScriptPath, \"rb\") as pythonDynamicImportFile: code = compile(pythonDynamicImportFile.read(), childPythonScriptPath, \"exec\") execGlobals = { \"globalKeyName\": \"globalKeyValue\" } execLocals = {} print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'globalKeyValue' exec(code, execGlobals, execLocals) print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'newValue' Reading and writing global variables in a child script def someFunction: global globalKeyName print(globalKeyName) # Will print out 'globalKeyValue' globalKeyName = \"newValue\" Each menu is its own python executable. The entry point is down the bottom of the file wrapped in a main() function to prevent variable scope creep. The code at the bottom of the main() function: if __name__ == 'builtins': Is actually where the execution path runs, all the code above it is just declared so that it can be called without ordering or scope issues. Optimisations It was obvious early on that the menu system would be slow on lower end devices, such as the Raspberry Pi, especially if it were rending a 4k terminal screen from a desktop via SSH. To mitigate this issue, not all of the screen is redrawn when there is a change. A \"Hotzone\" as it's called in the code, is usually rerendered when there's a change (such as pressing up or down to change an item selection, but not when scrolling). Full screen redraws are expensive and are only used when required, for example, when scrolling the pagination, selecting or deselecting a service, expanding or collapsing the menu and so on. Environments and encoding At the very beginning of the main menu screen ( ./scripts/main_menu.py ) the function checkRenderOptions() is run to determine what characters can be displayed on the screen. It will try various character sets, and eventually default to ASCII if none of the fancier stuff can be rendered. This setting is passed into of the sub menus through the submenu's global variables so that they don't have to recheck when they load. Sub-Menus From the main screen, you will see several sections leading to various submenus. Most of these menus work in the same way as the main menu. The only exception to this rule is the Build Stack menu, which is probably the most complex part of IOTstack. Build Stack Menu Path: ./scripts/buildstack_menu.py Loading Upon loading, the Build Stack menu will get a list of folders inside the ./templates directory and check for a build.py file inside each of them. This can be seen in the generateTemplateList() function, which is executed before the first rendering happens. The menu will then check if the file ./services/docker-compose.save.yml exists. This file is used to save the configuration of the last build. This happens in the loadCurrentConfigs() function. It is important that the service name in the compose file matches the folder name, any service that doesn't will either cause an error, or won't be loaded into the menu. If a previous build did exist the menu will then run the prepareMenuState() function that basically checks which items should be ticked, and check for any issues with the ticked items by running checkForIssues() . Selection and deselection When an item is selected, 3 things happen: 1. Update the UI variable ( menu ) with function checkMenuItem(selectionIndex) to let the user know the current state. 2. Update the array holding every checked item setCheckedMenuItems() . It uses the UI variable ( menu ) to know which items are set. 3. Check for any issues with the new list of selected items by running checkForIssues() . Check for options (submenus of services) During a full render sequence (this is not a hotzone render), the build stack menu checks to see if each of the services has an options menu. It does this by executing the build.py script of each of the services and passing in checkForOptionsHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a runOptionsMenu function. If the service's function result is true, without error, then the options text will appear up for that menu item. Check for issues When a service is selected or deselected on the menu, the checkForIssues() function is run. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForRunChecksHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a runChecks function. The runChecks function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Generally though, the runChecks function should check for conflicting port conflicts again any of the other services that are enabled. The menu will still allow you to build the stack, even if issues are present, assumine there's no errors raised during the build process. Prebuild hook Pressing enter on the Build Stack menu kicks off the build process. The Build Stack menu will execute the runPrebuildHook() function. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForPreBuildHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a preBuild function. The preBuild function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Some services may not even use the prebuild hook. The prebuild is very useful for setting up the services' configuration however. For example, it can be used to autogenerate a password for a paticular service, or copy and modify a configuration file from the ./.templates directory into the ./services or ./volumes directory. Postbuild hook The Build Stack menu will execute the runPostBuildHook() function in the final step of the build process, after the docker-compose.yml file has been written to disk. This function iterates through each of the selected menu items' folders executing the build.py script and passing in checkForPostBuildHook into the toRun global variable property to see if the script has a postBuild function. The postBuild function is different depending on the service, since each service has its own requirements. Most services won't require this function, but it can be useful for cleaning up temporary files and so on. The build process The selected services' yaml configuration is already loaded into memory before the build stack process is started. Run prebuildHooks. Create a new in memory docker-compose.yml structure. Merge the ./.templates/env.yml file into docker-compose.yml memory.

In simple terms, Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running. The Problem Let\u2019s say you have three different Python-based applications that you plan to host on a single server (which could either be a physical or a virtual machine). Each of these applications makes use of a different version of Python, as well as the associated libraries and dependencies, differ from one application to another. Since we cannot have different versions of Python installed on the same machine, this prevents us from hosting all three applications on the same computer. The Solution Let\u2019s look at how we could solve this problem without making use of Docker. In such a scenario, we could solve this problem either by having three physical machines, or a single physical machine, which is powerful enough to host and run three virtual machines on it. Both the options would allow us to install different versions of Python on each of these machines, along with their associated dependencies. The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms. So, whenever you plan to deploy an application on the host, it would create a logical entity on it to host that application. In Docker terminology, we call this logical entity a Container or Docker Container to be more precise. Whereas the kernel of the host\u2019s operating system is shared across all the containers that are running on it. This allows each container to be isolated from the other present on the same host. Thus it supports multiple containers with different application requirements and dependencies to run on the same host, as long as they have the same operating system requirements. Docker Terminology Docker Images and Docker Containers are the two essential things that you will come across daily while working with Docker. In simple terms, a Docker Image is a template that contains the application, and all the dependencies required to run that application on Docker. On the other hand, as stated earlier, a Docker Container is a logical entity. In more precise terms, it is a running instance of the Docker Image. What is Docker-Compose? Docker Compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together. Docker compose is a simple yet powerful tool that is used to run multiple containers as a single service. For example, suppose you have an application which requires Mqtt as a communication service between IOT devices and OpenHAB instance as a Smarthome application service. In this case by docker-compose, you can create one single file (docker-compose.yml) which will create both the containers as a single service without starting each separately. It wires up the networks (literally), mounts all volumes and exposes the ports. The IOTstack with the templates and menu is a generator for that docker-compose service descriptor. How Docker Compose Works? use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yaml) can start all the services with a single command ( docker-compose up ) can stop all the service with a single command ( docker-compose down ) How are the containers connected The containers are automagically connected when we run the stack with docker-compose up. The containers using same logical network (by default) where the instances can access each other with the instance logical name. Means if there is an instance called mosquitto and an openhab , when openHAB instance need to access mqtt on that case the domain name of mosquitto will be resolved as the runnuning instance of mosquitto. How the container are connected to host machine Volumes The containers are enclosed processes which state are lost with the restart of container. To be able to persist states volumes (images or directories) can be used to share data with the host. Which means if you need to persist some database, configuration or any state you have to bind volumes where the running service inside the container will write files to that binded volume. In order to understand what a Docker volume is, we first need to be clear about how the filesystem normally works in Docker. Docker images are stored as series of read-only layers. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it -- it still exists in the underlying layer. When a Docker container is deleted, relaunching the image will start a fresh container without any of the changes made in the previously running container -- those changes are lost, thats the reason that configs, databases are not persisted, Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. In IOTstack project uses the volumes directory in general to bind these container volumes. Ports When containers running a we would like to delegate some services to the outside world, for example OpenHAB web frontend have to be accessible for users. There are several ways to achive that. One is mounting the port to the most machine, this called port binding. On that case service will have a dedicated port which can be accessed, one drawback is one host port can be used one serice only. Another way is reverse proxy. The term reverse proxy (or Load Balancer in some terminology) is normally applied to a service that sits in front of one or more servers (in our case containers), accepting requests from clients for resources located on the server(s). From the client point of view, the reverse proxy appears to be the web server and so is totally transparent to the remote user. Which means several service can share same port the server will route the request by the URL (virtual domain or context path).

In such a scenario, we could solve this problem either by having three physical machines, or a single physical machine, which is powerful enough to host and run three virtual machines on it. Both the options would allow us to install different versions of Python on each of these machines, along with their associated dependencies. The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms. So, whenever you plan to deploy an application on the host, it would create a logical entity on it to host that application. In Docker terminology, we call this logical entity a Container or Docker Container to be more precise. Whereas the kernel of the host\u2019s operating system is shared across all the containers that are running on it. This allows each container to be isolated from the other present on the same host.

In this case by docker-compose, you can create one single file (docker-compose.yml) which will create both the containers as a single service without starting each separately.

To be able to persist states volumes (images or directories) can be used to share data with the host. Which means if you need to persist some database, configuration or any state you have to bind volumes where the running service inside the container will write files to that binded volume. In order to understand what a Docker volume is, we first need to be clear about how the filesystem normally works in Docker. Docker images are stored as series of read-only layers. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it -- it still exists in the underlying layer. When a Docker container is deleted, relaunching the image will start a fresh container without any of the changes made in the previously running container -- those changes are lost, thats the reason that configs, databases are not persisted, Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. In IOTstack project uses the volumes directory in general to bind these container volumes.","title":"Volumes"},{"location":"Understanding-Containers/#ports","text":"When containers running a we would like to delegate some services to the outside world, for example OpenHAB web frontend have to be accessible for users. There are several ways to achive that. One is mounting the port to the most machine, this called port binding. On that case service will have a dedicated port which can be accessed, one drawback is one host port can be used one serice only. Another way is reverse proxy. The term reverse proxy (or Load Balancer in some terminology) is normally applied to a service that sits in front of one or more servers (in our case containers), accepting requests from clients for resources located on the server(s). From the client point of view, the reverse proxy appears to be the web server and so is totally transparent to the remote user. Which means several service can share same port the server will route the request by the URL (virtual domain or context path). For example, there is grafana and openHAB instances, where the opeanhab.domain.tld request will be routed to openHAB instance 8181 port while grafana.domain.tld to grafana instance 3000 port.

Migrating to SensorsIot/IOTstack was fairly easy when this repository was first forked from gcgarner/IOTstack. Unfortunately, what was a fairly simple switching procedure no longer works properly because conflicts have emerged. The probability of conflicts developing increases as a function of time since the fork. Conflicts were and are pretty much inevitable so a more involved procedure is needed. Migration Steps Step 1 \u2013 Check your assumptions Make sure that you are, actually , on gcgarner. Don't assume! $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/gcgarner/IOTstack.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/gcgarner/IOTstack.git (push) Do not proceed if you don't see those URLs! Step 2 \u2013 Take IOTstack down Take your stack down. This is not strictly necessary but we'll be moving the goalposts a bit so it's better to be on the safe side. $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down Step 3 \u2013 Choose your migration method There are two basic approaches to switching from gcgarner/IOTstack to SensorsIot/IOTstack: Migration by changing upstream repository Migration by clone and merge You can think of the first as \"working with git\" while the second is \"using brute force\". The first approach will work if you haven't tried any other migration steps and/or have not made too many changes to items in your gcgarner/IOTstack that are under git control. If you are already stuck or you try the first approach and get a mess, or it all looks far too hard to sort out, then try the Migration by clone and merge approach. Migration Option 1 \u2013 change upstream repository Check for local changes Make sure you are on the master branch (you probably are so this is just a precaution), and then see if Git thinks you have made any local changes: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ git checkout master $ git status If Git reports any \"modified\" files, those will probably get in the way of a successful migration so it's a good idea to get those out of the way. For example, suppose you edited menu.sh at some point. Git would report that as: modified: menu.sh The simplest way to deal with modified files is to rename them to move them out of the way, and then restore the original: Rename your customised version by adding your initials to the end of the filename. Later, you can come back and compare your customised version with the version from GitHub and see if you want to preserve any changes. Here I'm assuming your initials are \"jqh\": $ mv menu.sh menu.sh.jqh Tell git to restore the unmodified version: $ git checkout -- menu.sh Now, repeat the Git command that complained about the file: $ git status The modified file will show up as \"untracked\" which is OK (ignore it) Untracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) menu.sh.jqh Synchronise with gcgarner on GitHub Make sure your local copy of gcgarner is in sync with GitHub. $ git pull Get rid of any upstream reference There may or may not be any \"upstream\" set. The most likely reason for this to happen is if you used your local copy as the basis of a Pull Request. The next command will probably return an error, which you should ignore. It's just a precaution. $ git remote remove upstream Point to SensorsIot Change your local repository to point to SensorsIot. $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git Synchronise with SensorsIot on GitHub This is where things can get a bit tricky so please read these instructions carefully before you proceed. When you run the next command, it will probably give you a small fright by opening a text-editor window. Don't panic - just keep reading. Now, run this command: $ git pull -X theirs origin master The text editor window will look something like this: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit. The first line is a pre-prepared commit message, the remainder is boilerplate instructions which you can ignore. Exactly which text editor opens is a function of your EDITOR environment variable and the core.editor set in your global Git configuration. If you: remember changing EDITOR and/or core.editor then, presumably, you will know how to interact with your chosen text editor. You don't need to make any changes to this file. All you need to do is save the file and exit; don't remember changing either EDITOR or core.editor then the editor will probably be the default vi (aka vim ). You need to type \":wq\" (without the quotes) and then press return. The \":\" puts vi into command mode, the \"w\" says \"save the file\" and \"q\" means \"quit vi \". Pressing return runs the commands. Git will display a long list of stuff. It's very tempting to ignore it but it's a good idea to take a closer look, particularly for signs of error or any lines beginning with: Auto-merging At the time of writing, you can expect Git to mention these two files: Auto-merging menu.sh Auto-merging .templates/zigbee2mqtt/service.yml Those are known issues and the merge strategy -X theirs on the git pull command you have just executed deals with both, correctly, by preferring the SensorsIot version. Similar conflicts may emerge in future and those will probably be dealt with, correctly, by the same merge strategy. Nevertheless, you should still check the output very carefully for other signs of merge conflict so that you can at least be alive to the possibility that the affected files may warrant closer inspection. For example, suppose you saw: Auto-merging .templates/someRandomService/service.yml If you don't use someRandomService then you could safely ignore this on the basis that it was \"probably right\". However, if you did use that service and it started to misbehave after migration, you would know that the service.yml file was a good place to start looking for explanations. Finish with a pull At this point, only the migrated master branch is present on your local copy of the repository. The next command brings you fully in-sync with GitHub: $ git pull Migration Option 2 \u2013 clone and merge If you have been following the process correctly, your IOTstack will already be down. Rename your existing IOTstack folder Move your old IOTstack folder out of the way, like this: $ cd ~ $ mv IOTstack IOTstack.old Note: You should not need sudo for the mv command but it is OK to use it if necessary. Fetch a clean clone of SensorsIot/IOTstack $ git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git ~/IOTstack Explore the result: $ tree -aFL 1 --noreport ~/IOTstack /home/pi/IOTstack \u251c\u2500\u2500 .bash_aliases \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 .native/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .templates/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .tmp/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 duck/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 install.sh* \u251c\u2500\u2500 menu.sh* \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/ Note: If the tree command is not installed for some reason, use ls -A1F ~/IOTstack . Observe what is not there: There is no docker-compose.yml There is no backups directory There is no services directory There is no volumes directory From this, it should be self-evident that a clean checkout from GitHub is the factory for all IOTstack installations, while the contents of backups , services , volumes and docker-compose.yml represent each user's individual choices, configuration options and data. Merge old into new Execute the following commands: $ mv ~/IOTstack.old/docker-compose.yml ~/IOTstack $ mv ~/IOTstack.old/services ~/IOTstack $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/volumes ~/IOTstack You should not need to use sudo for the first two commands. However, if you get a permissions conflict on either, you should proceed like this: docker-compose.yml $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/docker-compose.yml ~/IOTstack $ sudo chown pi:pi ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml services $ sudo mv ~/IOTstack.old/services ~/IOTstack $ sudo chown -R pi:pi ~/IOTstack/services There is no need to migrate the backups directory. You are better off creating it by hand: $ mkdir ~/IOTstack/backups Step 4 \u2013 Choose your menu If you have reached this point, you have migrated to SensorsIot/IOTstack where you are on the \"master\" branch. This implies \"new menu\". The choice of menu is entirely up to you. Differences include: New menu takes a lot more screen real-estate than old menu. If you do a fair bit of work on small screens (eg iPad) you might find it hard to work with new menu. New menu creates a large number of internal Docker networks whereas old menu has one internal network to rule them all . The practical consequence is that most users see error messages for networks being defined but not used, and occasionally run into problems where two containers can't talk to each other without tinkering with the networks. Neither of those happen under old menu. See Issue 245 if you want more information on this. New menu has moved the definition of environment variables into docker-compose.yml . Old menu keeps environment variables in \"environment files\" in ~/IOTstack/services . There is no \"right\" or \"better\" about either approach. It's just something to be aware of. Under new menu, the service.yml files in ~/IOTstack/.templates have all been left-shifted by two spaces. That means you can no longer use copy and paste to test containers - you're stuck with the extra work of re-adding the spaces. Again, this doesn't matter but you do need to be aware of it. What you give up when you choose old menu is summarised in the following. If a container appears on the right hand side but not the left then it is only available in new menu. old-menu master (new menu) \u251c\u2500\u2500 adminer \u251c\u2500\u2500 adminer \u251c\u2500\u2500 blynk_server \u251c\u2500\u2500 blynk_server \u251c\u2500\u2500 dashmachine \u251c\u2500\u2500 dashmachine \u251c\u2500\u2500 deconz \u251c\u2500\u2500 deconz \u251c\u2500\u2500 diyhue \u251c\u2500\u2500 diyhue \u251c\u2500\u2500 domoticz \u251c\u2500\u2500 domoticz \u251c\u2500\u2500 dozzle \u251c\u2500\u2500 dozzle \u251c\u2500\u2500 espruinohub \u251c\u2500\u2500 espruinohub > \u251c\u2500\u2500 example_template \u251c\u2500\u2500 gitea \u251c\u2500\u2500 gitea \u251c\u2500\u2500 grafana \u251c\u2500\u2500 grafana \u251c\u2500\u2500 heimdall \u251c\u2500\u2500 heimdall > \u251c\u2500\u2500 home_assistant \u251c\u2500\u2500 homebridge \u251c\u2500\u2500 homebridge \u251c\u2500\u2500 homer \u251c\u2500\u2500 homer \u251c\u2500\u2500 influxdb \u251c\u2500\u2500 influxdb \u251c\u2500\u2500 mariadb \u251c\u2500\u2500 mariadb \u251c\u2500\u2500 mosquitto \u251c\u2500\u2500 mosquitto \u251c\u2500\u2500 motioneye \u251c\u2500\u2500 motioneye \u251c\u2500\u2500 nextcloud \u251c\u2500\u2500 nextcloud \u251c\u2500\u2500 nodered \u251c\u2500\u2500 nodered \u251c\u2500\u2500 openhab \u251c\u2500\u2500 openhab \u251c\u2500\u2500 pihole \u251c\u2500\u2500 pihole \u251c\u2500\u2500 plex \u251c\u2500\u2500 plex \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer_agent \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer_agent \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer-ce \u251c\u2500\u2500 portainer-ce \u251c\u2500\u2500 postgres \u251c\u2500\u2500 postgres \u251c\u2500\u2500 prometheus \u251c\u2500\u2500 prometheus \u251c\u2500\u2500 python \u251c\u2500\u2500 python \u251c\u2500\u2500 qbittorrent \u251c\u2500\u2500 qbittorrent \u251c\u2500\u2500 rtl_433 \u251c\u2500\u2500 rtl_433 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tasmoadmin \u251c\u2500\u2500 tasmoadmin \u251c\u2500\u2500 telegraf \u251c\u2500\u2500 telegraf \u251c\u2500\u2500 timescaledb \u251c\u2500\u2500 timescaledb \u251c\u2500\u2500 transmission \u251c\u2500\u2500 transmission \u251c\u2500\u2500 webthings_gateway \u251c\u2500\u2500 webthings_gateway \u251c\u2500\u2500 wireguard \u251c\u2500\u2500 wireguard \u2514\u2500\u2500 zigbee2mqtt \u251c\u2500\u2500 zigbee2mqtt > \u2514\u2500\u2500 zigbee2mqtt_assistant You also give up the compose-override.yml functionality. On the other hand, Docker has its own docker-compose.override.yml which works with both menus. If you want to switch to the old menu: $ git checkout old-menu Any time you want to switch back to the new menu: $ git checkout master You can switch back and forth as much as you like and as often as you like. It's no harm, no foul. The branch you are on just governs what you see when you run: $ ./menu.sh Although you can freely change branches, it's probably not a good idea to try to mix-and-match your menus. Pick one menu and stick to it. Even so, nothing will change until you run your chosen menu to completion and allow it to generate a new docker-compose.yml . Step 5 \u2013 Bring up your stack Unless you have gotten ahead of yourself and have already run the menu (old or new) then nothing will have changed in the parts of your ~/IOTstack folder that define your IOTstack implementation.

When you run the next command, it will probably give you a small fright by opening a text-editor window. Don't panic - just keep reading. Now, run this command: $ git pull -X theirs origin master The text editor window will look something like this: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit. The first line is a pre-prepared commit message, the remainder is boilerplate instructions which you can ignore. Exactly which text editor opens is a function of your EDITOR environment variable and the core.editor set in your global Git configuration. If you: remember changing EDITOR and/or core.editor then, presumably, you will know how to interact with your chosen text editor. You don't need to make any changes to this file. All you need to do is save the file and exit; don't remember changing either EDITOR or core.editor then the editor will probably be the default vi (aka vim ). You need to type \":wq\" (without the quotes) and then press return. The \":\" puts vi into command mode, the \"w\" says \"save the file\" and \"q\" means \"quit vi \". Pressing return runs the commands. Git will display a long list of stuff. It's very tempting to ignore it but it's a good idea to take a closer look, particularly for signs of error or any lines beginning with: Auto-merging At the time of writing, you can expect Git to mention these two files: Auto-merging menu.sh Auto-merging .templates/zigbee2mqtt/service.yml Those are known issues and the merge strategy -X theirs on the git pull command you have just executed deals with both, correctly, by preferring the SensorsIot version. Similar conflicts may emerge in future and those will probably be dealt with, correctly, by the same merge strategy. Nevertheless, you should still check the output very carefully for other signs of merge conflict so that you can at least be alive to the possibility that the affected files may warrant closer inspection. For example, suppose you saw: Auto-merging .templates/someRandomService/service.yml If you don't use someRandomService then you could safely ignore this on the basis that it was \"probably right\". However, if you did use that service and it started to misbehave after migration, you would know that the service.yml file was a good place to start looking for explanations.","title":" Synchronise with SensorsIot on GitHub "},{"location":"gcgarner-migration/#finish-with-a-pull","text":"At this point, only the migrated master branch is present on your local copy of the repository.

This implies \"new menu\". The choice of menu is entirely up to you. Differences include: New menu takes a lot more screen real-estate than old menu. If you do a fair bit of work on small screens (eg iPad) you might find it hard to work with new menu. New menu creates a large number of internal Docker networks whereas old menu has one internal network to rule them all . The practical consequence is that most users see error messages for networks being defined but not used, and occasionally run into problems where two containers can't talk to each other without tinkering with the networks. Neither of those happen under old menu. See Issue 245 if you want more information on this. New menu has moved the definition of environment variables into docker-compose.yml . Old menu keeps environment variables in \"environment files\" in ~/IOTstack/services . There is no \"right\" or \"better\" about either approach. It's just something to be aware of. Under new menu, the service.yml files in ~/IOTstack/.templates have all been left-shifted by two spaces. That means you can no longer use copy and paste to test containers - you're stuck with the extra work of re-adding the spaces. Again, this doesn't matter but you do need to be aware of it. What you give up when you choose old menu is summarised in the following.

If its value is \"admin\" then you will be forced to change it the first time you login to Grafana. If its value is something other than \"admin\" then that will be the password until you change it via the web UI. These two environment keys only work for the first launch of Grafana. Once Grafana has been launched, you can never change either the username or the password by editing grafana.env . For this reason, it is better to leave grafana.env in its shrink-wrapped state.

Settings are described in terms of how they appear in \".ini\" files. An example of the sort of thing you might want to do is to enable anonymous access to your Grafana dashboards. The Grafana documentation describes this in \".ini\" format as: [auth.anonymous] enabled = true # Organization name that should be used for unauthenticated users org_name = Main Org. # Role for unauthenticated users, other valid values are `Editor` and `Admin` org_role = Viewer \".ini\" format is not really appropriate in a Docker context. Instead, you use environment variables to override Docker's settings. Environment variables are placed in ~/IOTstack/services/grafana/grafana.env . You need to convert \".ini\" format to environment variable syntax. The rules are: Start with \"GF_\", then Append the [section name], replacing any periods with underscores, then Append the section key \"as is\", then Append an \"=\", then Append the right hand side in quotes. Applying those rules gets you: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=\"true\" GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_NAME=\"Main Org.\" GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=\"Viewer\" It is not strictly necessary to encapsulate every right hand side value in quotes. In the above, both \"true\" and \"Viewer\" would work without quotes, whereas \"Main Org.\" needs quotes because of the embedded space. After you have changed ~/IOTstack/services/grafana/grafana.env , you need to propagate the changes into the Grafana container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop grafana $ docker-compose up -d In theory, the second command could be omitted, or both the second and third commands could be replaced with \"docker-compose restart grafana\" but experience suggests stopping the container is more reliable. A slightly more real-world example would involve choosing a different default organisation name for anonymous access. This example uses \"ChezMoi\". First, the environment key needs to be set to that value: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_NAME=ChezMoi Then that change needs to be propagated into the Grafana container as explained above.

It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control. Port binding is 8123 . Hass.io is exposed to your hosts' network in order to discover devices on your LAN. That means that it does not sit inside Docker's network. To avoid confusion There are two versions of Home Assistant: Hass.io, and Home Assistant Docker. Hass.io uses its own orchestration with 3 docker images: hassio_supervisor , hassio_dns and homeassistant . Home Assistant Docker runs inside a single Docker image, and doesn't support all the features that Hass.io does (such as add-ons). IOTstack allows installing either, but we can only offer limited configuration of Hass.io since it is its own platform. More info on versions . Menu installation Hass.io installation can be found inside the Native Installs menu on the main menu. Home Assistant can be found in the Build Stack menu. You will be asked to select your device type during the installation. Hass.io is no longer dependant on the IOTstack, it has its own service for maintaining its uptime. Installation Hass.io creates a conundrum: If you are definitely going to install Hass.io then you must install its dependencies before you install Docker. One of Hass.io's dependencies is Network Manager . Network Manager makes serious changes to your operating system, with side-effects you may not expect such as giving your Raspberry Pi's WiFi interface a random MAC address both during the installation and, then, each time you reboot. You are in for a world of pain if you install Network Manager without first understanding what is going to happen and planning accordingly. If you don't install Hass.io's dependencies before you install Docker, you will either have to uninstall Docker or rebuild your system. This is because both Docker and Network Manager adjust your Raspberry Pi's networking. Docker is happy to install after Network Manager, but the reverse is not true. If Docker is already installed, uninstall it $ sudo apt -y purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io $ sudo apt -y remove docker-compose $ sudo pip3 uninstall docker-compose Note that this does not interfere with your existing ~/IOTstack folder. Ensure your system is fully up-to-date $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y Install Hass.io dependencies (stage 1) $ sudo apt install -y apparmor apparmor-profiles apparmor-utils $ sudo apt install -y software-properties-common apt-transport-https ca-certificates dbus The first line is required. A post at community.home-assistant.io implies the second line may also be required but it is not clear whether those packages are strictly necessary. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via Ethernet You can skip this step if you interact with your Raspberry Pi via a screen connected to its HDMI port, along with a keyboard and mouse. If, however, you are running \"headless\" (SSH or VNC), connect your Raspberry Pi to Ethernet. When the Ethernet interface initialises, work out its IP address: $ ifconfig eth0 eth0: flags = 4163 <UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 inet 192 .168.132.9 netmask 255 .255.255.0 broadcast 192 .168.132.255 ether ab:cd:ef:12:34:56 txqueuelen 1000 ( Ethernet ) RX packets 4166292 bytes 3545370373 ( 3 .3 GiB ) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 2086814 bytes 2024386593 ( 1 .8 GiB ) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 In the above, the IP address assigned to the Ethernet interface is 192.168.132.9. Drop out of your existing session (SSH or VNC) and re-connect to your Raspberry Pi using the IP address assigned to its Ethernet interface: $ ssh pi@192.168.132.9 or: vnc://pi@192.168.132.9 The reason for stipulating the IP address, rather than a name like raspberrypi.local is so that you are definitely connected to the Ethernet interface. If you ignore the advice about connecting via Ethernet and install Network Manager while your session is connected via WiFi, your connection will freeze part way through the installation (when Network Manager starts running and unconditionally changes your Raspberry Pi's WiFi MAC address). If you want to know more about why the connection freezes, see why random MACs are such a hassle . You may be able to re-connect after the WiFi interface acquires a new IP address and advertises that via multicast DNS associated with the name of your device (eg raspberrypi.local ), but you may also find that the only way to regain control is to power-cycle your Raspberry Pi. The advice about using Ethernet is well-intentioned. You should heed this advice even if means you need to temporarily relocate your Raspberry Pi just so you can attach it via Ethernet for the next few steps. You can go back to WiFi later, once everything is set up. You have been warned! Install Hass.io dependencies (stage 2) Install Network Manager: $ sudo apt install -y network-manager Consider disabling random MAC address allocation According to @steveatk on Discord , you can stop Network Manager from allocating random MAC addresses to your WiFi interface by editing: $ sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and adding: [ device ] wifi.scan-rand-mac-address = no This needs to be done twice : after Network Manager is installed; and again after Hass.io is installed via the IOTstack menu. In both cases, NetworkManager.conf is replaced with a version that enables random MAC allocation. Re-install docker If you had to uninstall Docker in the earlier step, now is the time to re-install it. You can use the menu or one of the scripts provided with IOTstack but it is probably just as easy to run: $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh $ sudo usermod -G docker -a $USER $ sudo usermod -G bluetooth -a $USER $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev $ sudo pip3 install -U docker-compose $ sudo pip3 install -U ruamel.yaml == 0 .16.12 blessed $ sudo reboot Note that this does not interfere with your existing ~/IOTstack folder. Run the Hass.io installation Start at: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh and then navigate to the installation option. The installation of Hass.io takes up to 20 minutes (depending on your internet connection). Refrain from restarting your machine until it has come online and you are able to create a user account. Removal To remove Hass.io you first need to stop the service that controls it. Run the following in the terminal: $ sudo systemctl stop hassio-supervisor.service $ sudo systemctl disable hassio-supervisor.service This should stop the main service however there are two additional container that still need to be address This will stop the service and disable it from starting on the next boot. Next you need to stop the hassio_dns and hassio_supervisor : $ docker stop hassio_supervisor $ docker stop hassio_dns $ docker stop homeassistant If you want to remove the containers: $ docker rm hassio_supervisor $ docker rm hassio_dns $ docker stop homeassistant After rebooting you should be able to reinstall. The stored files are located in /usr/share/hassio which can be removed if you need to. Double-check with docker ps to see if there are other hassio containers running. They can stopped and removed in the same fashion for the dns and supervisor. You can use Portainer to view what is running and clean up the unused images. Why random MACs are such a hassle This material was originally posted as part of Issue 312 . It was moved here following a suggestion by lole-elol . When you connect to a Raspberry Pi via SSH, that's a protocol that is riding on top of TCP/IP. SSH (the layer 4 protocol) uses TCP (a connection-oriented protocol) which rides on IP (the layer 3 protocol). So far, so good. But you also need to know what happens at layers 2 and 1. When your SSH client (eg Mac or PC or another Unix box) opens its SSH connection, at layer 3 the IP stack applies the subnet mask against the IP addresses of both the source device (your Mac, PC, etc) and destination device (Raspberry Pi) to split them into \"network portion\" (on the left) and \"host portion\" on the right. It then compares the two network portions and, if they are the same, it says \"local network\". To complete the picture, if they do not compare the same, then IP substitutes the so-called \"default gateway\" address (ie your router) and repeats the mask-and-compare process which, unless something is seriously mis-configured, will result in those comparing the same and being \"local network\". This is why data-comms gurus sometimes say, \"all networking is local\". What happens next depends on the data communications media but we'll assume Ethernet and WiFi seeing as they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes. The source machine (Mac, PC, etc) issues an ARP (address resolution protocol). It is a broadcast frame (we talk about \"frames\" rather than \"packets\" at Layer 2) asking the question, \"who has this destination IP address?\" The Raspberry Pi responds with a unicast packet saying, \"that's me\" and part of that includes the MAC (media access control) address of the Raspberry Pi. The source machine only does this once (and this is a key point). It assumes the relationship between IP address and MAC address will not change and it adds the relationship to its \"ARP cache\". You can see the cache on any Unix computer with: $ arp -a The Raspberry Pi makes the same assumption: it has learned both the IP and MAC address of the source machine (Mac, PC, etc) from the ARP request and has added that to its own ARP cache. In addition, every layer two switch (got one of those in your home?) has been snooping on this traffic and has learned, for each of its ports, which MAC address(es) are on those ports. Not \"MAC and IP\". A switch works at Layer 2. All it sees are frames. It only caches MAC addresses! When the switch saw the ARP broadcast, it replicated that out of all of its ports but when the \"that's me\" came back from the Raspberry Pi as a unicast response, it only went out on the switch port where the source machine (Mac, PC, etc) was attached. After that, it's all caching. The Mac or PC has a packet to send to the Pi. It finds the hit in its ARP cache, wraps the packet in a frame and sends it out its Ethernet or WiFi interface. Any switches receive the frame, consult their own tables, and send the frame out the port on the next hop to the destination device. It doesn't matter whether you have one switch or several in a cascade, they have all learned the \"next hop\" to each destination MAC address they have seen. Ditto when the Pi sends back any reply packets. ARP. Switch. Mac/PC. All cached. The same basic principles apply, irrespective of whether the \"switching function\" is wired (Ethernet) or WiFi, so it doesn't really matter if your home arrangement is as straightforward as Mac or PC and Pi, both WiFi, via a local WiFi \"hub\" which is either standalone or part of your router. If something is capable of learning where a MAC is, it does. Still so far so good. Now comes the problem. You have established an SSH session connected to the Pi over its WiFi interface. You install Network Manager. As part of its setup, Network Manager discards the fixed MAC address which is burned into the Pi's WiFi interface and substitutes a randomly generated MAC address. It doesn't ask for permission to do that. It doesn't warn you it's about to do it. It just does it. When the WiFi interface comes up, it almost certainly \"speaks\" straight away via DHCP to ask for an IP address. The DHCP server looks in its own table of MAC-to-IP associations (fixed or dynamic, doesn't matter) and says \"never seen that MAC before - here's a brand new IP address lease\". The DHCP request is broadcast so all the switches will have learned the new MAC but they'll also still have the old MAC (until it times out). The Mac/PC will receive the DHCP broadcast but, unless it's the DHCP server, will discard it. Either way, it has no means of knowing that this new random MAC belongs to the Pi so it can't do anything sensible with the information. Meanwhile, SSH is trying to keep the session alive. It still thinks \"old IP address\" and its ARP cache still thinks old IP belongs to old MAC. Switches know where the frames are meant to go but even if a frame does get somewhere near the Pi, the Pi's NIC (network interface card) ignores it because it's the wrong destination MAC. The upshot is that SSH looks like the session has frozen and it will eventually time-out with a broken pipe. To summarise: Network Manager has changed the MAC without so much as a by-your-leave and, unless you have assigned static IP addresses in the Raspberry Pi it's quite likely that the Pi will have a different IP address as well. But even a static IP can't save you from the machinations of Network Manager! The Pi is as happy as the proverbial Larry. It goes on, blissfully unaware that it has just confused the heck out of everything else. You can speed-up some of the activities that need to happen before everything gets going again. You can do things like clear the old entry from the ARP cache on the Mac/PC. You can try to force a multicast DNS daemon restart so that the \"raspberrypi.local\" address gets updated more quickly but mDNS is a distributed database so it can be hit and miss (and can sometimes lead to complaints about two devices trying to use the same name). Usually, the most effective thing you can do is pull power from the Pi, reboot your Mac/PC (easiest way to clear its ARP cache) and then apply power to the Pi so that it announces its mDNS address at the right time for the newly-booted Mac/PC to hear it and update its mDNS records. That's why the installation advice says words to the effect of: whatever else you do, don't try to install Network Manager while you're connected over WiFi. If SSH is how you're going to do it, you're in for a world of pain if you don't run an Ethernet cable for at least that part of the process. And it does get worse, of course. Installing Network Manager turns on random WiFi MAC. You can turn it off and go back to the fixed MAC. But then, when you install Docker, it happens again. It may also be that other packages come along in future and say, \"hey, look, Network Manager is installed - let's take advantage of that\" and it happens again when you least expect it. Devices changing their MACs at random is becoming reasonably common. If you have a mobile device running a reasonably current OS, it is probably changing its MAC all the time. The idea is to make it hard for Fred's Corner Store to track you and conclude, \"Hey, Jim is back in the shop again.\" Random MACs are not a problem for a client device like a phone, tablet or laptop. But they are definitely a serious problem for a server device. In TCP/IP any device can be a client or a server for any protocol. The distinction here is about typical use. A mobile device is not usually set up to offer services like MQTT or Node-RED. It typically initiates connections with servers like Docker containers running on a Raspberry Pi. It is not just configuration-time SSH sessions that break. If you decide to leave Raspberry Pi random Wifi MAC active and you have other clients (eq IoT devices) communicating with the Pi over WiFi, you will wrong-foot those clients each time the Raspberry Pi reboots. Data communications services from those clients will be impacted until those client devices time-out and catch up.","title":"Home assistant"},{"location":"Containers/Home-Assistant/#home-assistant","text":"","title":"Home assistant"},{"location":"Containers/Home-Assistant/#references","text":"Docker Webpage Hass.io is a home automation platform running on Python 3.

The Dockerfile used to customise Mosquitto for IOTstack. A replacement for the Eclipse-Mosquitto script of the same name, extended to handle container self-repair. A standard set of defaults for IOTstack (used to initialise defaults on first run, and for container self-repair). The working service definition (only relevant to old-menu, copied from \u2776). The Compose file (includes \u2776). The persistent storage area : Directories and files in \u277c are owned by userID 1883. This is enforced each time Mosquitto starts. You will normally need sudo to make changes in this area. Each time Mosquitto starts, it automatically replaces anything originating in \u2779 that has gone missing from \u277c. This \"self-repair\" function is intended to provide reasonable assurance that Mosquitto will at least start instead of going into a restart loop. How Mosquitto gets built for IOTstack Mosquitto source code ( GitHub ) The source code for Mosquitto lives at GitHub eclipse/mosquitto . Mosquitto images ( DockerHub ) Periodically, the source code is recompiled and the resulting image is pushed to eclipse-mosquitto on DockerHub . IOTstack menu When you select Mosquitto in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose Mosquitto as one of your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d See also the Migration considerations (below). docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the mosquitto fragment, it finds: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto build: ./.templates/mosquitto/. \u2026 The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: FROM eclipse-mosquitto:latest If you need to pin to a particular version of Mosquitto, the Dockerfile is the place to do it. See Mosquitto version pinning . The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add the rsync and tzdata packages. rsync helps the container perform self-repair; while tzdata enables Mosquitto to respect the \"TZ\" environment variable. Add a standard set of configuration defaults appropriate for IOTstack. Replace docker-entrypoint.sh with a version which: Calls rsync to perform self-repair if configuration files go missing; and Enforces 1883:1883 ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto . The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Mosquitto has been built, you will see two rows for Mosquitto: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_mosquitto latest cf0bfe1a34d6 4 weeks ago 11 .6MB eclipse-mosquitto latest 46ad1893f049 4 weeks ago 8 .31MB eclipse-mosquitto is the base image ; and iotstack_mosquitto is the local image . You will see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Migration considerations Under the original IOTstack implementation of Mosquitto (just \"as it comes\" from DockerHub ), the service definition expected the configuration files to be at: ~/IOTstack/services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ~/IOTstack/services/mosquitto/filter.acl Under this implementation of Mosquitto, the configuration files have moved to: ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/filter.acl The change of location is one of the things that allows self-repair to work properly. The default versions of each configuration file are the same . Only the locations have changed. If you did not alter either file when you were running the original IOTstack implementation of Mosquitto, there will be no change in Mosquitto's behaviour when it is built from a Dockerfile . However, if you did alter either or both configuration files, then you should compare the old and new versions and decide whether you wish to retain your old settings. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ diff ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf You can also use the -y option on the diff command to see a side-by-side comparison of the two files. Using mosquitto.conf as the example, assume you wish to use your existing file instead of the default: To move your existing file into the new location: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo mv ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf The move overwrites the default. At this point, the moved file will probably be owned by user \"pi\" but that does not matter. Mosquitto will always enforce correct ownership (1883:1883) on any restart but it will not overwrite permissions. If in doubt, use mode 644 as your default for permissions: $ sudo chmod 644 ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf Restart Mosquitto: $ docker-compose restart mosquitto Check your work: $ ls -l ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 1883 1883 ssss mmm dd hh:mm ./volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf If necessary, repeat these steps with filter.acl . Logging Mosquitto logging is controlled by mosquitto.conf . This is the default configuration: #log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log log_dest stdout log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S When log_dest is set to stdout , you inspect Mosquitto's logs like this: $ docker logs mosquitto Logs written to stdout are ephemeral and will disappear when your Mosquitto container is rebuilt, but this type of configuration reduces wear and tear on your SD card. The alternative, which may be more appropriate if you are running on an SSD or HD, is to change mosquitto.conf to be like this: log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log #log_dest stdout log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S and then restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart mosquitto The path /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log is an internal path. When this style of logging is active, you inspect Mosquitto's logs using the external path like this: $ sudo tail ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log You need to use sudo because the log is owned by userID 1883 and Mosquitto creates it without \"world\" read permission. Logs written to mosquitto.log do not disappear when your IOTstack is restarted. They persist until you take action to prune the file. Security Configuring security Mosquitto security is controlled by mosquitto.conf . These are the relevant directives: #password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile allow_anonymous true Mosquitto security can be in four different states, which are summarised in the following table: password_file allow_anonymous security enforcement remark disabled true open access default disabled false all access denied not really useful enabled true credentials optional enabled false credentials required Password file management The password file for Mosquitto is part of a mapped volume: The internal path is /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile The external path is ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile A common problem with the previous version of Mosquitto for IOTstack occurred when the password_file directive was enabled but the pwfile was not present. Mosquitto went into a restart loop. The Mosquitto container performs self-repair each time the container is brought up or restarts. If pwfile is missing, an empty file is created as a placeholder. This prevents the restart loop. What happens next depends on allow_anonymous : If true then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be permitted; Any MQTT request with credentials will be rejected (because pwfile is empty so there is nothing to match on). If false then all MQTT requests will be rejected. create username and password To create a username and password, use the following as a template. $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb \u00abpassword\u00bb Replace \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb with appropriate values, then execute the command. For example, to create the username \"hello\" with password \"world\": $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile hello world check password file There are two ways to verify that the password file exists and has the expected content: View the file using its external path: $ sudo cat ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile sudo is needed because the file is neither owned nor readable by pi . View the file using its internal path: $ docker exec mosquitto cat /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile Each credential starts with the username and occupies one line in the file: hello:$7$101$ZFOHHVJLp2bcgX+h$MdHsc4rfOAhmGG+65NpIEJkxY0beNeFUyfjNAGx1ILDmI498o4cVOaD9vDmXqlGUH9g6AgHki8RPDEgjWZMkDA== remove entry from password file To remove an entry from the password file: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -D /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb reset the password file There are several ways to reset the password file. Your options are: Remove the password file and restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ sudo rm ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile $ docker-compose restart mosquitto The result is an empty password file. Clear all existing passwords while adding a new password: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -c -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile \u00abusername\u00bb \u00abpassword\u00bb The result is a password file with a single entry. Clear all existing passwords in favour of a single dummy password which is then removed: $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -c -b /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile dummy dummy $ docker exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd -D /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile dummy The result is an empty password file. Activate Mosquitto security Use sudo and your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf Remove the comment indicator from the following line: #password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile so that it becomes: password_file /mosquitto/pwfile/pwfile Set allow_anonymous as required: allow_anonymous true If true then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be permitted; The validity of credentials supplied with any MQTT request will be enforced. If false then: Any MQTT request without credentials will be rejected; The validity of credentials supplied with any MQTT request will be enforced. Save the modified configuration file and restart Mosquitto: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart mosquitto Testing Mosquitto security assumptions You have created at least one username (\"hello\") and password (\"world\"). password_file is enabled. allow_anonymous is false . install testing tools If you do not have the Mosquitto clients installed on your Raspberry Pi (ie $ which mosquitto_pub does not return a path), install them using: $ sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients test: anonymous access is prohibited Test without providing credentials: $ mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" Connection Refused: not authorised. Error: The connection was refused. Note: The error is the expected result and shows that Mosquitto will not allow anonymous access. test: access with credentials is permitted Test with credentials $ mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" -u hello -P world $ Note: The absence of any error message means the message was sent. Silence = success! test: round-trip with credentials is permitted Prove round-trip connectivity will succeed when credentials are provided. First, set up a subscriber as a background process. This mimics the role of a process like Node-Red: $ mosquitto_sub -v -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -F \"%I %t %p\" -u hello -P world & [1] 25996 Repeat the earlier test: $ mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -m \"up up and away\" -u hello -P world 2021-02-16T14:40:51+1100 /password/test up up and away Note: the second line above is coming from the mosquitto_sub running in the background. When you have finished testing you can kill the background process (press return twice after you enter the kill command): $ kill %1 $ [1]+ Terminated mosquitto_sub -v -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t \"/password/test\" -F \"%I %t %p\" -u hello -P world Upgrading Mosquitto You can update most containers like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Mosquitto is available is to check the eclipse-mosquitto tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Mosquitto like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull mosquitto $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; mosquitto is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Mosquitto container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your MQTT broker service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Mosquitto version pinning If you need to pin Mosquitto to a particular version: Use your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/.templates/mosquitto/Dockerfile Find the line: FROM eclipse-mosquitto:latest Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to. For example, to pin to version 2.0.10: FROM eclipse-mosquitto:2.0.10 Save the file and tell docker-compose to rebuild the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build mosquitto $ docker system prune The new local image is built, then the new container is instantiated based on that image. The prune deletes the old local image . Note: As well as preventing Docker from updating the base image , pinning will also block incoming updates to the Dockerfile from a git pull . Nothing will change until you decide to remove the pin. About Port 9001 Earlier versions of the IOTstack service definition for Mosquitto included two port mappings: ports: - \"1883:1883\" - \"9001:9001\" Issue 67 explored the topic of port 9001 and showed that: The base image for Mosquitto did not expose port 9001; and The running container was not listening to port 9001. On that basis, the mapping for port 9001 was removed from service.yml . If you have a use-case that needs port 9001, you can re-enable support by: Inserting the port mapping under the mosquitto definition in docker-compose.yml : - \"9001:9001\" Inserting the additional listener in mosquitto.conf : listener 1883 listener 9001 You need both lines. If you omit 1883 then Mosquitto will stop listening to port 1883 and will only listen to port 9001. Restarting the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart mosquitto Please consider raising an issue to document your use-case. If you think your use-case has general application then please also consider creating a pull request to make the changes permanent.","title":"Mosquitto"},{"location":"Containers/Mosquitto/#mosquitto","text":"This document discusses an IOTstack-specific version of Mosquitto built on top of Eclipse/Mosquitto using a Dockerfile .

This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Mosquitto is available is to check the eclipse-mosquitto tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Mosquitto like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull mosquitto $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; mosquitto is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Mosquitto container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap.

If you see any evidence of restarts, try to figure out why using: $ docker logs nextcloud If you want to be sure Nextcloud gets set up correctly, it is best to perform the remaining steps from a different computer. That means you need to decide how that other computer will refer to your Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud.

You can (and should) fix it later by completing the steps in \"Access through untrusted domain\" . On a computer that is not the Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud, launch a browser and point to the Raspberry Pi running Nextcloud using your chosen connection method. Examples: If you are using an IP address: http://192.168.203.200:9321 If you are using a domain name: http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321 If you are using a host name in /etc/hosts : http://myrpi:9321 The expected result is: Create an administrator account and then click \"Finish Setup\".

And then you get an error: If you examine the contents of your browser's URL bar, you will find: http://localhost/index.php/core/apps/recommended That is clearly wrong and it is probably a bug in Nextcloud. 10. Edit the URL to replace localhost with what it should be, which will be one of the following patterns, depending on which method you chose to access Nextcloud: http://192.168.203.200:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended http://myrpi:9321/index.php/core/apps/recommended Note: This seems to be the only time Nextcloud misbehaves and forces localhost into a URL.

Then the dashboard will be obscured by the \"Nextcloud Hub\" floating window: Hover your mouse to the right of the floating window and keep clicking on the right-arrow button until you reach the last screen, then click \"Start using Nextcloud\". Congratulations. Your IOTstack implementation of Nextcloud is ready to roll: \"Access through untrusted domain\" During Nextcloud initialisation you had to choose between an IP address, a domain name or a host name. Now that Nextcloud is running, you have the opportunity to expand your connection options. If you are reading this because you are staring at an \"access through untrusted domain\" message then you have come to the right place. Let's assume the following: You used raspi-config to give your Raspberry Pi the name \"myrpi\". Your Raspberry Pi has the fixed IP address \"192.168.203.200\" (via either a static binding in your DHCP server or a static IP address on your Raspberry Pi). Out of the box, a Raspberry Pi participates in multicast DNS so it will also have the mDNS name: \"myrpi.local\" Let's also assume you have a local Domain Name System server where your Raspberry Pi: has the canonical name (A record) \"myrpi.mydomain.com\"; plus an alias (CNAME record) of \"nextcloud.mydomain.com\". Rolling all that together, you would expect your Nextcloud service to be reachable at any of the following URLs: http://192.168.203.200:9321 http://myrpi.local:9321 http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321 http://nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321 To tell Nextcloud that all of those URLs are valid, you need to use sudo and your favourite text editor to edit this file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/config.php Hint: It is a good idea to make a backup of any file before you edit it. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/ $ sudo cp config.php config.php.bak Search for \"trusted_domains\". To tell Nextcloud to trust all of the URLs above, edit the array structure like this: 'trusted_domains' => array ( 0 => '192.168.203.200:9321', 1 => 'myrpi.local:9321', 2 => 'myrpi.mydomain.com:9321', 3 => 'nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321', ), Note: all the trailing commas are intentional! Once you have finished editing the file, save your work then restart Nextcloud: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nextcloud Use docker ps to check that the container has restarted properly and hasn't gone into a restart loop. See also: Nextcloud documentation - trusted domains . Using a DNS alias for your Nextcloud service The examples above include using a DNS alias (a CNAME record) for your Nextcloud service. If you decide to do that, you may see this warning in the log: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name You can silence the warning by editing the Nextcloud service definition in docker-compose.yml to add your fully-qualified DNS alias to at hostname directive. For example: hostname: nextcloud.mydomain.com Security considerations Nextcloud traffic is not encrypted. Do not expose it to the web by opening a port on your home router. Instead, use a VPN like Wireguard to provide secure access to your home network, and let your remote clients access Nextcloud over the VPN tunnel. Keeping Nextcloud up-to-date To update the nextcloud container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull nextcloud $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud $ docker system prune To update the nextcloud_db container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull nextcloud_db $ docker-compose up -d nextcloud_db $ docker system prune $ docker system prune The first \"prune\" removes the old local image, the second removes the old base image. Backups Nextcloud is currently excluded from the IOTstack-supplied backup scripts due to its potential size. This is also true for Paraphraser/IOTstackBackup . If you want to take a backup, something like the following will get the job done: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ BACKUP_TAR_GZ=$PWD/backups/$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d_%H%M\").$HOSTNAME.nextcloud-backup.tar.gz $ touch \"$BACKUP_TAR_GZ\" $ docker-compose stop nextcloud nextcloud_db $ docker-compose rm -f nextcloud nextcloud_db $ sudo tar -czf \"$BACKUP_TAR_GZ\" -C \"./volumes/nextcloud\" . $ docker-compose up -d Note: A baseline backup takes over 400MB and about 2 minutes. Once you start adding your own data, it will take even more time and storage. To restore, you first need to identify the name of the backup file by looking in the backups directory. Then: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ RESTORE_TAR_GZ=$PWD/backups/2021-06-12_1321.sec-dev.nextcloud-backup.tar.gz $ docker-compose stop nextcloud nextcloud_db $ docker-compose rm -f nextcloud nextcloud_db $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/nextcloud/* $ sudo tar -x --same-owner -z -f \"$RESTORE_TAR_GZ\" -C \"./volumes/nextcloud\" $ docker-compose up -d If you are running from an SD card, it would be a good idea to mount an external drive to store the data. Something like: The external drive will have to be an ext4 formatted drive because smb, fat32 and NTFS can't handle Linux file permissions. If the permissions aren't set to \"www-data\" then the container won't be able to write to the disk.

Rolling all that together, you would expect your Nextcloud service to be reachable at any of the following URLs: http://192.168.203.200:9321 http://myrpi.local:9321 http://myrpi.mydomain.com:9321 http://nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321 To tell Nextcloud that all of those URLs are valid, you need to use sudo and your favourite text editor to edit this file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/config.php Hint: It is a good idea to make a backup of any file before you edit it. For example: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/nextcloud/html/config/ $ sudo cp config.php config.php.bak Search for \"trusted_domains\". To tell Nextcloud to trust all of the URLs above, edit the array structure like this: 'trusted_domains' => array ( 0 => '192.168.203.200:9321', 1 => 'myrpi.local:9321', 2 => 'myrpi.mydomain.com:9321', 3 => 'nextcloud.mydomain.com:9321', ), Note: all the trailing commas are intentional! Once you have finished editing the file, save your work then restart Nextcloud: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nextcloud Use docker ps to check that the container has restarted properly and hasn't gone into a restart loop.

SSH directory (mapped volume). How Node-RED gets built for IOTstack Node-RED source code ( GitHub ) The source code for Node-RED lives at GitHub node-red/node-red-docker . Node-RED images ( DockerHub ) Periodically, the source code is recompiled and pushed to nodered/node-red on DockerHub . There's a lot of stuff at that page but it boils down to variations on two basic themes: images with a suffix like -10 , -12 or -14 ; and images without a numeric suffix. The suffixes refer to the version of \"Node.js\" installed when the image was built. In the case of images without a numeric suffix: If the version of Node-RED is 1.3.x then a suffix of -10 is implied. In other words, Node.js defaults to version 10. If the version of Node-RED is 2.x.x then a suffix of -14 is implied. In other words, Node.js defaults to version 14. As you will see a bit further down, the current default for IOTstack is an image tag of latest-12 which means Node-RED 2.x.x with Node.js version 12. IOTstack menu When you select Node-RED in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. You choose add-on nodes from a supplementary menu. We recommend accepting the default nodes, and adding others that you think you are likely to need. Node-RED will not build if you do not select at least one add-on node. Key points: Under new menu, you must press the right arrow to access the supplementary menu. Under old menu, the list of add-on nodes is displayed automatically. Do not be concerned if you can't find an add-on node you need in the list. You can also add nodes via Manage Palette once Node-RED is running. See adding extra nodes . Choosing add-on nodes in the menu causes the Dockerfile to be created. IOTstack first run On a first install of IOTstack, you are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the nodered fragment, it finds: nodered: container_name: nodered build: ./services/nodered/. \u2026 The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile The Dockerfile begins with: FROM nodered/node-red:latest-12 Note: IOTstack switched to the -12 suffix in March 2021. Existing IOTstack installations will not update unless you re-create the service from its template, or hand-edit the Dockerfile . The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the latest base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The local image is instantiated to become your running container. Notes: During the build you may see warnings and deprecation notices. You may also see messages about \"vulnerabilities\" along with recommendations to run npm audit fix . You should ignore all such messages. There is no need to take any action. If SQLite is in your list of nodes, be aware that it needs to be compiled from its source code. It takes a long time, outputs an astonishing number of warnings and, from time to time, will look as if it has gotten stuck. Be patient. Acknowledgement: Successful installation of the SQLite node is thanks to @fragolinux. When you run the docker images command after Node-RED has been built, you will see two rows for Node-RED: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_nodered latest b0b21a97b8bb 4 days ago 462MB nodered/node-red latest deb99584fa75 5 days ago 385MB nodered/node-red is the base image ; and iotstack_nodered is the local image . The local image is the one that is instantiated to become the running container. You will see the same pattern in Portainer, which reports the base image as \"unused\": You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Securing Node-RED Setting an encryption key for your credentials After you install Node-RED, you should set an encryption key. Completing this step will silence the warning you will see when you run: $ docker logs nodered \u2026 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Your flow credentials file is encrypted using a system-generated key. If the system-generated key is lost for any reason, your credentials file will not be recoverable, you will have to delete it and re-enter your credentials. You should set your own key using the 'credentialSecret' option in your settings file. Node-RED will then re-encrypt your credentials file using your chosen key the next time you deploy a change. --------------------------------------------------------------------- \u2026 Setting an encryption key also means that any credentials you create will be portable , in the sense that you can backup Node-RED on one machine and restore it on another. The encryption key can be any string. For example, if you have UUID support installed ( sudo apt install -y uuid-runtime ), you could generate a UUID as your key: $ uuidgen 2deb50d4-38f5-4ab3-a97e-d59741802e2d Once you have defined your encryption key, use sudo and your favourite text editor to open this file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/settings.js Search for credentialSecret : //credentialSecret: \"a-secret-key\", Un-comment the line and replace a-secret-key with your chosen key. Do not remove the comma at the end of the line. The result should look something like this: credentialSecret: \"2deb50d4-38f5-4ab3-a97e-d59741802e2d\", Save the file and then restart Node-RED: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Setting a username and password for Node-RED To secure Node-RED you need a password hash. Run the following command, replacing PASSWORD with your own password: $ docker exec nodered node -e \"console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 8));\" PASSWORD You will get an answer that looks something like this: $2a$08$gTdx7SkckJVCw1U98o4r0O7b8P.gd5/LAPlZI6geg5LRg4AUKuDhS Copy that text to your clipboard, then follow the instructions at Node-RED User Guide - Securing Node-RED - Username & Password-based authentication . Referring to other containers Node-RED can run in two modes. By default, it runs in \"non-host mode\" but you can also move the container to \"host mode\" by editing the Node-RED service definition in your Compose file to: Add the following directive: network_mode: host Remove the ports directive and the mapping of port 1880. When Node-RED is not in host mode Most examples on the web assume Node-RED and other services in the MING (Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Node-RED, Grafana) stack have been installed natively, rather than in Docker containers. Those examples typically include the loopback address + port syntax, like this: 127.0.0.1:1883 The loopback address will not work when Node-RED is in non-host mode. This is because each container behaves like a self-contained computer. The loopback address means \"this container\". It does not mean \"this Raspberry Pi\". You refer to other containers by their container name. For example, a flow subscribing to an MQTT feed provided by the mosquitto container uses: mosquitto:1883 Similarly, if a flow writes to an InfluxDB database maintained by the influxdb container, the flow uses: influxdb:8086 Behind the scenes, Docker maintains a table similar to an /etc/hosts file mapping container names to the IP addresses on the internal bridged network that are assigned, dynamically, by Docker when it spins up each container. When Node-RED is in host mode This is where you use loopback+port syntax, such as the following to communicate with Mosquitto: 127.0.0.1:1883 What actually occurs is that Docker is listening to external port 1883 on behalf of Mosquitto. It receives the packet and routes it (layer three) to the internal bridged network, performing network address translation (NAT) along the way to map the external port to the internal port. Then the packet is delivered to Mosquitto. The reverse happens when Mosquitto replies. It works but is less efficient than when all containers are in non-host mode. GPIO Access To communicate with your Raspberry Pi's GPIO you need to do the following: Install dependencies: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio Install the node-red-node-pi-gpiod node. See Adding extra nodes . It allows you to connect to multiple Pis from the same Node-RED service. Make sure that the pigpdiod daemon is running. The recommended method is listed here . In essence, you need to: Use sudo to edit /etc/rc.local ; Before the exit 0 statement, insert the line: /usr/bin/pigpiod Reboot. You can also pass parameters to pigpiod to secure the service. See the writeup for further instructions. Drag a gpio node onto the canvas and configure it using the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg 192.168.1.123). Don't try to use 127.0.0.1 because that is the loopback address of the Node-RED container. Sharing files between Node-RED and the Raspberry Pi Containers run in a sandboxed environment. A process running inside a container can't see the Raspberry Pi's file system. Neither can a process running outside a container access files inside the container. This presents a problem if you want write to a file outside a container, then read from it inside the container, or vice-versa. IOTstack containers have been set up with shared volume mappings. Each volume mapping associates a specific directory in the Raspberry Pi file system with a specific directory inside the container. If you write to files in a shared directory (or one of its sub-directories), both the host and the container can see the same sub-directories and files. Key point: Files and directories in the shared volume are persistent between restarts. If you save your data anywhere else inside the container, it will be lost when the container is rebuilt. The Node-RED service definition in the Compose file includes the following: volumes: - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data That decomposes into: external path = ./volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data The leading \".\" on the external path implies \"the folder containing the Compose file so it actually means: external path = ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data If you write to the internal path from inside the Node-RED container, the Raspberry Pi will see the results at the external path, and vice versa. Example: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # echo \"The time now is $(date)\" >/data/example.txt # cat /data/example.txt The time now is Thu Apr 1 11 :25:56 AEDT 2021 # exit $ cat ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/example.txt The time now is Thu Apr 1 11 :25:56 AEDT 2021 $ sudo rm ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/example.txt In words: Open a shell into the Node-RED container. Two things happen: You are now inside the container. Any commands you execute while in this shell are run inside the container; and The prompt changes to a \"#\" indicating that you are running as the \"root\" user, meaning you don't need sudo for anything. Use the echo command to create a small file which embeds the current timestamp. The path is in the /data directory which is mapped to the Raspberry Pi's file system. Show that the file has been created inside the container. Exit the shell: You can either type the exit command and press return, or press Control+D. Exiting the shell drops you out of the container so the \"$\" prompt returns, indicating that you are outside the Node-Red container, running as a non-root user (\"pi\"). Show that the same file can be seen from outside the container. Tidy-up by removing the file. You need sudo to do that because the persistent storage area at the external path is owned by root, and you are running as user \"pi\". You can do the same thing from within a Node-RED flow. The flow comprises: An Inject node, wired to a Template node. When an Inject node's input tab is clicked, it sets the message payload to the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC and triggers the flow. A Template node, wired to both a Debug node and a File node. The template field is set to: The time at the moment is {{payload}} seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC ! When this node runs, it replaces {{payload}} with the seconds value supplied by the Inject node. A Debug node. When this node runs, it displays the payload in the debug window on the right hand side of the Node-RED GUI. A File node. The \"Filename\" field of the node is set to write to the path: /data/flow-example.txt When this node runs, it writes the payload to the specified file. Remember that /data is an internal path within the Node-RED container. Deploying the flow and clicking on the Inject node results in the debug message shown on the right hand side of the screen shot. The embedded terminal window shows that the same information is accessible from outside the container. You can reverse this process. Any file you place within the path ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data can be read by a \"File in\" node. Executing commands outside the Node-RED container A reasonably common requirement in a Node-RED flow is the ability to execute a command on the host system. The standard tool for this is an \"exec\" node. An \"exec\" node works as expected when Node-RED is running as a native service but not when Node-RED is running in a container. That's because the command spawned by the \"exec\" node runs inside the container. To help you understand the difference, consider this command: $ grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release When you run that command on a Raspberry Pi outside container-space, the answer is: PRETTY_NAME=\"Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)\" If you run the same command inside a Node-RED container, the output will be: PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.11\" The same thing will happen if a Node-RED \"exec\" node executes that grep command when Node-RED is running in a container. It will see the \"Alpine Linux\" answer. Docker doesn't provide any mechanism for a container to execute an arbitrary command outside of its container. A workaround is to utilise SSH. This remainder of this section explains how to set up the SSH scaffolding so that \"exec\" nodes running in a Node-RED container can invoke arbitrary commands outside container-space. Task Goal Be able to use a Node-RED exec node to perform the equivalent of: $ ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb where: \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb is any host under your control (not just the Raspberry Pi running IOTstack); and \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb is any command known to the target host. Assumptions SensorsIot/IOTstack is installed on your Raspberry Pi. The Node-RED container is running. These instructions are specific to IOTstack but the underlying concepts should apply to any installation of Node-RED in a Docker container. Executing commands \"inside\" a container These instructions make frequent use of the ability to run commands \"inside\" the Node-RED container. For example, suppose you want to execute: $ grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release You have several options: You can do it from the normal Raspberry Pi command line using a Docker command. The basic syntax is: $ docker exec { -it } \u00abcontainerName\u00bb \u00abcommand and parameters\u00bb The actual command you would need would be: $ docker exec nodered grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release Note: The -it flag is optional . It means \"interactive terminal\". Its presence tells Docker that the command may need user interaction, such as entering a password or typing \"yes\" to a question. You can open a shell into the container, run as many commands as you like inside the container, and then exit. For example: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release # whoami # exit $ In words: Run the bash shell inside the Node-RED container. You need to be able to interact with the shell to type commands so the -it flag is required. The \"#\" prompt is coming from bash running inside the container. It also signals that you are running as the root user inside the container. You run the grep , whoami and any other commands. You finish with the exit command (or Control+D). The \"$\" prompt means you have left the container and are back at the normal Raspberry Pi command line. Run the command from Portainer by selecting the container, then clicking the \">_ console\" link. This is identical to opening a shell. Variable definitions You will need to have a few concepts clear in your mind before you can set up SSH successfully. I use double-angle quote marks (guillemets) to mean \"substitute the appropriate value here\". \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb (required) The name of your Raspberry Pi. When you first booted your RPi, it had the name \"raspberrypi\" but you probably changed it using raspi-config . Example: iot-dev \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb (required) Either or both of the following: \u00abHOSTFQDN\u00bb (optional) If you have a local Domain Name System server, you may have defined a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Raspberry Pi. Example: iot-dev.mydomain.com Note: Docker's internal networks do not support multicast traffic. You can't use a multicast DNS name (eg \"raspberrypi.local\") as a substitute for a fully-qualified domain name. \u00abHOSTIP\u00bb (required) Even if you don't have a fully-qualified domain name, you will still have an IP address for your Raspberry Pi. Example: 192.168.132.9 Keep in mind that a Raspberry Pi running IOTstack is operating as a server . A dynamic DHCP address is not appropriate for a server. The server's IP address needs to be fixed. The two standard approaches are: a static DHCP assignment configured on your DHCP server (eg your router) which always returns the same IP address for a given MAC address; or a static IP address configured on your Raspberry Pi. \u00abUSERID\u00bb (required) The user ID of the account on \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb where you want Node-RED flows to be able to run commands. Example: pi Step 1: Generate SSH key-pair for Node-RED (one time) Create a key-pair for Node-RED. This is done by executing the ssh-keygen command inside the container: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -C \"Node-RED container key-pair\" -N \"\" Notes: The \"ed25519\" elliptic curve algorithm is recommended (generally described as quicker and more secure than RSA) but you can use the default RSA algorithm if you prefer. Respond to the \"Enter file in which to save the key\" prompt by pressing return to accept the default location. If ssh-keygen displays an \"Overwrite (y/n)?\" message, it implies that a key-pair already exists. You will need to decide what to do: press \"y\" to overwrite (and lose the old keys) press \"n\" to terminate the command, after which you can investigate why a key-pair already exists. Step 2: Exchange keys with target hosts (once per target host) Node-RED's public key needs to be copied to the user account on each target machine where you want a Node-RED \"exec\" node to be able to execute commands. At the same time, the Node-RED container needs to learn the public host key of the target machine. The ssh-copy-id command does both steps. The required syntax is: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb Examples: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.132.9 The output will be something similar to the following: /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \"/root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\" The authenticity of host 'iot-dev.mydomain.com (192.168.132.9)' can't be established. ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:HVoeowZ1WTSG0qggNsnGwDA6acCd/JfVLZsNUv4hjNg. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Respond to the prompt by typing \"yes\" and press return. The output continues: /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed expr: warning: '^ERROR: ': using '^' as the first character of a basic regular expression is not portable; it is ignored /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com's password: The response may look like it contains errors but those can be ignored. Enter the password you use to login as \u00abUSERID\u00bb on \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb and press return. Normal completion looks similar to this: Number of key(s) added: 1 Now try logging into the machine, with: \"ssh 'pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com'\" and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added. If you do not see an indication that a key has been added, you may need to retrace your steps. Step 3: Perform the recommended test The output above recommends a test. The test needs to be run inside the Node-RED container so the syntax is: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Examples: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh pi@iot-dev.mydomain.com ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack $ docker exec -it nodered ssh pi@192.168.132.9 ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack You should not be prompted for a password. If you are, you may need to retrace your steps. If everything works as expected, you should see a list of the files in your IOTstack folder. Assuming success, think about what just happened? You told SSH inside the Node-RED container to run the ls command outside the container on your Raspberry Pi. You broke through the containerisation. Understanding what's where and what each file does What files are where Six files are relevant to Node-RED's ability to execute commands outside of container-space: in /etc/ssh : ssh_host_ed25519_key is the Raspberry Pi's private host key ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub is the Raspberry Pi's public host key Those keys were created when your Raspberry Pi was initialised. They are unique to the host. Unless you take precautions, those keys will change whenever your Raspberry Pi is rebuilt from scratch and that will stop SSH from working. You can recover by re-running ssh-copy-id . in ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh : id_ed25519 is the Node-RED container's private key id_ed25519.pub is the Node-RED container's public key Those keys were created when you generated the SSH key-pair for Node-RED. They are unique to Node-RED but will follow the container in backups and will work on the same machine, or other machines, if you restore the backup. It does not matter if the Node-RED container is rebuilt or if a new version of Node-RED comes down from DockerHub. These keys will remain valid until lost or overwritten. If you lose or destroy these keys, SSH will stop working. You can recover by generating new keys and then re-running ssh-copy-id . known_hosts The known_hosts file contains a copy of the Raspberry Pi's public host key. It was put there by ssh-copy-id . If you lose this file or it gets overwritten, SSH will still work but will re-prompt for authorisation to connect. This works when you are running commands from docker exec -it but not when running commands from an exec node. Note that authorising the connection at the command line (\"Are you sure you want to continue connecting?\") will auto-repair the known_hosts file. in ~/.ssh/ : authorized_keys That file contains a copy of the Node-RED container's public key. It was put there by ssh-copy-id . Pay attention to the path. It implies that there is one authorized_keys file per user, per target host. If you lose this file or it gets overwritten, SSH will still work but will ask for the password for \u00abUSERID\u00bb. This works when you are running commands from docker exec -it but not when running commands from an exec node. Note that providing the correct password at the command line will auto-repair the authorized_keys file. What each file does SSH running inside the Node-RED container uses the Node-RED container's private key to provide assurance to SSH running outside the container that it (the Node-RED container) is who it claims to be. SSH running outside container-space verifies that assurance by using its copy of the Node-RED container's public key in authorized_keys . SSH running outside container-space uses the Raspberry Pi's private host key to provide assurance to SSH running inside the Node-RED container that it (the RPi) is who it claims to be. SSH running inside the Node-RED container verifies that assurance by using its copy of the Raspberry Pi's public host key stored in known_hosts . Config file (optional) You don't have to do this step but it will simplify your exec node commands and reduce your maintenance problems if you do. At this point, SSH commands can be executed from inside the container using this syntax: # ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb A config file is needed to achieve the task goal of the simpler syntax: # ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb \u00abCOMMAND\u00bb A config file does not just simplify connection commands. It provides isolation between the \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb and \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb such that you only have a single file to change if your \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb changes (eg new IP address or fully qualified domain name). It also exposes less about your network infrastructure when you share your flows. The goal is to set up this file: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh/config The file needs the ownership and permissions shown. There are several ways of going about this and you are free to choose the one that works for you. The method described here creates the file first, then sets correct ownership and permissions, and then moves the file into place. Start in a directory where you can create a file without needing sudo . The IOTstack folder is just as good as anywhere else: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ touch config Select the following text, copy it to the clipboard. host \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb hostname \u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb user \u00abUSERID\u00bb IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 Open ~/IOTstack/config in your favourite text editor and paste the contents of the clipboard. Replace the \u00abdelimited\u00bb keys. Completed examples: If you are using the \u00abHOSTFQDN\u00bb form: host iot-dev hostname iot-dev.mydomain.com user pi IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 If you are using the \u00abHOSTIP\u00bb form: host iot-dev hostname 192.168.132.9 user pi IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 Save the file. Change the config file's ownership and permissions, and move it into the correct directory: $ chmod 644 config $ sudo chown root:root config $ sudo mv config ./volumes/nodered/ssh Re-test with config file in place The previous test used this syntax: $ docker exec nodered ssh \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Now that the config file is in place, the syntax changes to: $ docker exec nodered ssh \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack Example: $ docker exec nodered ssh iot-dev ls -1 /home/pi/IOTstack The result should be the same as the earlier test. A test flow In the Node-RED GUI: Click the \"+\" to create a new, empty flow. Drag the following nodes onto the canvas: One \"inject\" node Two \"exec\" nodes Two \"debug\" nodes Wire the outlet of the \"inject\" node to the inlet of both \"exec\" nodes. Wire the uppermost \"stdout\" outlet of the first \"exec\" node to the inlet of the first \"debug\" node. Repeat step 4 with the other \"exec\" and \"debug\" node. Open the first \"exec\" node and: set the \"command\" field to: grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release - turn off the \"append msg.payload\" checkbox - set the timeout to a reasonable value (eg 10 seconds) - click \"Done\". 7. Repeat step 6 with the other \"exec\" node, with one difference: - set the \"command\" field to: ssh iot-dev grep \"^PRETTY_NAME=\" /etc/os-release Click the Deploy button. Set the right hand panel to display debug messages. Click the touch panel of the \"inject\" node to trigger the flow. Inspect the result in the debug panel. You should see payload differences similar to the following: PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.11\" PRETTY_NAME=\"Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)\" The first line is the result of running the command inside the Node-RED container. The second line is the result of running the same command outside the Node-RED container on the Raspberry Pi. Suppose you want to add another \u00abHOSTNAME\u00bb Exchange keys with the new target host using: $ docker exec -it nodered ssh-copy-id \u00abUSERID\u00bb@\u00abHOSTADDR\u00bb Edit the config file at the path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/ssh/config to define the new host. Remember to use sudo to edit the file. There is no need to restart Node-RED or recreate the container. Upgrading Node-RED You can update most containers like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This strategy doesn't work for Node-RED. The local image ( iotstack_nodered ) does not exist on DockerHub so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Node-RED is available is to check the nodered/node-red tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Node-RED like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull nodered $ docker-compose up -d nodered $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; nodered is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Node-RED container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your Node-RED service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up old images. Sometimes you need to run this twice, the first time to clean up the old local image, the second time for the old base image. Customising Node-RED You customise your local image of Node-RED by making changes to: ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile You apply a Dockerfile change like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d nodered $ docker system prune The --build option on the up command (as distinct from a docker-compose build command) works in this situation because you've made a substantive change to your Dockerfile . Node.js version Out of the box, IOTstack starts the Node-RED Dockerfile with: FROM nodered/node-red:latest-12 The -12 suffix means \" node.js is pinned at version 12.x.x\". That's the latest version of node.js that Node-RED currently supports. If you want to check which version of node.js is installed on your system, you can do it like this: $ docker exec nodered node --version In the unlikely event that you need to run an add-on node that needs version 10 of node.js , you can pin to version 10.x.x by changing the first line of your Dockerfile like this: FROM nodered/node-red:latest-10 Once you have made that change, follow the steps at apply Dockerfile changes . Adding extra packages As well as providing the Node-RED service, the nodered container is an excellent testbed. Installing the DNS tools, Mosquitto clients and tcpdump will help you to figure out what is going on inside container-space. There are two ways to add extra packages. The first method is to add them to the running container. For example, to add the Mosquitto clients: $ docker exec nodered apk add --no-cache mosquitto-clients The \"apk\" implies that the Node-RED container is based on Alpine Linux. Keep that in mind when you search for instructions on installing packages. Packages installed this way will persist until the container is re-created (eg a down and up of the stack, or a reboot of your Raspberry Pi). This is a good choice if you only want to run a quick experiment. The second method changes the Dockerfile to add the packages permanently to your build. You just append the packages to the end of the existing apk add : RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache eudev-dev mosquitto-clients bind-tools tcpdump You can add as many extra packages as you like. They will persist until you change the Dockerfile again. Once you have made this change, follow the steps at apply Dockerfile changes . Adding extra nodes You can install nodes by: Adding nodes to the Dockerfile and then following the steps at apply Dockerfile changes . This is also what will happen if you re-run the menu and change the selected nodes, except that the menu will also blow away any other customisations you may have made to your Dockerfile . Adding, removing or updating nodes in Manage Palette. Node-RED will remind you to restart Node-RED and that is something you have to do by hand: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Note: Some users have reported misbehaviour from Node-RED if they do too many iterations of: [ make a single change in Manage Palette ] $ docker-compose restart nodered [ make a single change in Manage Palette ] $ docker-compose restart nodered \u2026 It is better to: [ do ALL your Manage Palette changes ] $ docker-compose restart nodered Installing nodes inside the container via npm: $ docker exec -it nodered bash # cd /data # npm install \u00abnode-name\u00bb /data # exit $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart nodered Note: You must put the /data onto the end of the npm install command. Any formula you find on the web will not include this. You have to remember to do it yourself! See also the note above about restarting too frequently. You can use this approach if you need to force the installation of a specific version (which you don't appear to be able to do in Manage Palette). For example, to install version 4.0.0 of the \"moment\" node: # npm install node-red-contrib-moment@4.0.0 /data There is no real difference between the methods. Some nodes (eg \"node-red-contrib-generic-ble\" and \"node-red-node-sqlite\" must be installed by Dockerfile but the only way of finding out if a node must be installed via Dockerfile is to try Manage Palette and find that it doesn't work. Aside from the exception cases that require Dockerfile or where you need to force a specific version, it is quicker to install nodes via Manage Palette and applying updates is a bit easier too. But it's really up to you. If you're wondering about \"backup\", nodes installed via: Dockerfile \u2013 implicitly backed up when the Dockerfile is backed-up. Manage Palette or npm install \u2013 explicitly backed up when the ~/IOTstack/volumes directory is backed-up. Basically, if you're running IOTstack backups then your add-on nodes will be backed-up. Node precedence Add-on nodes that are installed via Dockerfile wind up at the internal path: /usr/src/node-red/node_modules Add-on nodes installed via Manage Palette wind up at the external path: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules The Compose file volumes mapping: ./volumes/nodered/data:/data implies that add-on nodes installed via Manage Palette are made available to Node-RED at the internal path: /data/node_modules Because there are two places, this invites the question of what happens if a given node is installed in both? The answer is that add-ons installed at: /data/node_modules take precedence over those installed at: /usr/src/node-red/node_modules Or, to put it more simply: in any contest, Manage Palette prevails over Dockerfile . Resolving node duplication Sometimes, even when you are 100% certain that you didn't do it, an add-on node will turn up in both places. There is probably some logical reason for this but I don't know what it is. The problem this creates is that a later version of an add-on node installed via Dockerfile will be blocked by the presence of an older version of that node in: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules The nodered_list_installed_nodes.sh script helps discover when this situation exists. For example: $ ~/IOTstack/scripts/nodered_list_installed_nodes.sh Nodes installed by Dockerfile INSIDE the container at /usr/src/node-red/node_modules ACTIVE: node-red-admin ACTIVE: node-red-configurable-ping ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-boolean-logic ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-generic-ble ACTIVE: node-red-contrib-influxdb ACTIVE: node-red-dashboard BLOCKED: node-red-node-email ACTIVE: node-red-node-pi-gpiod ACTIVE: node-red-node-rbe ACTIVE: node-red-node-sqlite ACTIVE: node-red-node-tail Nodes installed by \u00abManage Palette\u00bb OUTSIDE the container at /home/pi/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules node-red-contrib-boolean-logic-ultimate node-red-contrib-chartjs node-red-node-email node-red-contrib-md5 node-red-contrib-moment node-red-contrib-pushsafer Notice how node-red-node-email appears in both lists. To fix this problem: Move into the correct external directory: $ cd ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/node_modules Create a sub-directory to be the equivalent of a local trash can: $ sudo mkdir duplicates Move each duplicate node into the duplicates directory. For example, to move node-red-node-email you would: $ sudo mv node-red-node-email duplicates Tell Node-RED to restart. This causes it to forget about the nodes which have just been moved out of the way: $ docker-compose -f ~/IOTstack/docker-compose.yml restart nodered Finish off by erasing the duplicates folder: $ sudo rm -rf duplicates Always be extremely careful with any rm -rf , particularly when it is coupled with a sudo .

A process running inside a container can't see the Raspberry Pi's file system. Neither can a process running outside a container access files inside the container. This presents a problem if you want write to a file outside a container, then read from it inside the container, or vice-versa. IOTstack containers have been set up with shared volume mappings. Each volume mapping associates a specific directory in the Raspberry Pi file system with a specific directory inside the container. If you write to files in a shared directory (or one of its sub-directories), both the host and the container can see the same sub-directories and files. Key point: Files and directories in the shared volume are persistent between restarts. If you save your data anywhere else inside the container, it will be lost when the container is rebuilt. The Node-RED service definition in the Compose file includes the following: volumes: - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data That decomposes into: external path = ./volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data The leading \".\" on the external path implies \"the folder containing the Compose file so it actually means: external path = ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data internal path = /data If you write to the internal path from inside the Node-RED container, the Raspberry Pi will see the results at the external path, and vice versa.

Any commands you execute while in this shell are run inside the container; and The prompt changes to a \"#\" indicating that you are running as the \"root\" user, meaning you don't need sudo for anything.

Show that the file has been created inside the container. Exit the shell: You can either type the exit command and press return, or press Control+D.

You need sudo to do that because the persistent storage area at the external path is owned by root, and you are running as user \"pi\". You can do the same thing from within a Node-RED flow.

When an Inject node's input tab is clicked, it sets the message payload to the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC and triggers the flow. A Template node, wired to both a Debug node and a File node. The template field is set to: The time at the moment is {{payload}} seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC ! When this node runs, it replaces {{payload}} with the seconds value supplied by the Inject node. A Debug node. When this node runs, it displays the payload in the debug window on the right hand side of the Node-RED GUI. A File node. The \"Filename\" field of the node is set to write to the path: /data/flow-example.txt When this node runs, it writes the payload to the specified file. Remember that /data is an internal path within the Node-RED container. Deploying the flow and clicking on the Inject node results in the debug message shown on the right hand side of the screen shot.

The /dev/ttyAMA0 device is used as a default because it is always present on Raspbian. If you bring up your container like that, the mapping will succeed and the container is unlikely to go into a restart loop. However, the OctoPrint container is unlikely to be able to connect to your 3D printer via /dev/ttyAMA0 for the very simple reason that that is not how 3D printers usually appear on the Raspberry Pi. You need to work out how your printer presents itself and change the device mapping accordingly. option 1 - /dev/ttyUSBn Using \"ttyUSBn\" will \"work\" but, because of the inherent variability in the name, this approach is not recommended. The \"n\" in the \"ttyUSBn\" can vary depending on which USB devices are attached to your Raspberry Pi and the order in which they are attached. The \"n\" may also change as you add and remove devices. If the OctoPrint container is up when the device number changes, the container will crash, and it will either go into a restart loop if you try to bring it up when the expected device is not \"there\", or will try to communicate with a device that isn't your 3D printer. option 2 - /dev/serial/by-id/xxxxxxxx The \"xxxxxxxx\" is (usually) unique to your 3D printer. To find it, connect your printer to your Raspberry Pi, then run the command: $ ls -1 /dev/serial/by-id You will get an answer like this: usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102N_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_3b14eaa48a154d5e87032d59459d5206-if00-port0 Note: If you have multiple serial devices attached, you will get multiple lines in the output. It is up to you to sort out which one belongs to your 3D printer, possibly by disconnecting and re-attaching the printer and observing how the list changes. The uniqueness of device IDs is under the control of the device manufacturer. Each manufacturer should ensure their devices are unique but some manufacturers are more diligent than others.

In other words, if you have two or more Raspberry Pis and a collection of serial devices (3D printers, Zigbee adapters, UARTs, and so on), a 3D printer will always get the same by-id name, irrespective of which Raspberry Pi it is attached to. device by-id names do not persist if the physical device is disconnected.

Use this line as a template: SUBSYSTEM==\"tty\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"\u00abidVendor\u00bb\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"\u00abidProduct\u00bb\", ATTRS{serial}==\"\u00abSerialNumber\u00bb\", SYMLINK+=\"\u00absensibleName\u00bb\" Replace the \u00abdelimited\u00bb values with those you see in the log output. For example, given the above log output, and the desire to associate your 3D printer with the human-readable name of \"MasterDisaster5000Pro\", the result would be: SUBSYSTEM==\"tty\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"dead\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"beef\", ATTRS{serial}==\"cafe80facefeed\", SYMLINK+=\"MasterDisaster5000Pro\" Next, ensure the required file exists by executing the following command: $ sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules If the file does not exist already, the touch command creates an empty file, owned by root, with mode 644 (rw-r--r--) permissions (all of which are correct). Use sudo and your favourite text editor to edit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules and insert the \"SUBSYSTEM==\" line you prepared earlier into that file, then save the file. Rules files are read on demand so there is no start or reload command to execute. Check your work by disconnecting, then re-connecting your 3D printer, and then run: $ ls /dev You should expect to see the human-readable name you chose in the list of devices. You can then edit docker-compose.yml to use the name in the device mapping. devices: - /dev/MasterDisaster5000Pro:/dev/ttyACM0 Notes: device names follow the device. In other words, if you have two or more Raspberry Pis and a collection of serial devices (3D printers, Zigbee adapters, UARTs, and so on), you can build a single 99-usb-serial.rules file that you install on all of your Raspberry Pis. Then, you can attach a named device to any of your Raspberry Pis and it will always get the same name. device names do not persist if the physical device is disconnected. If you switch off your 3D printer or disconnect the USB cable while the OctoPrint container is running, the container will crash. the /dev/video0:/dev/video0 mapping The /dev/video0 device is assumed to be an official Raspberry Pi camera attached via ribbon cable. See the Webcams topic of the Octoprint Community Forum for help configuring other kinds of cameras. The OctoPrint docker image includes an MJPG streamer. You do not need to run another container with a streamer unless you want to. To activate a Raspberry Pi camera attached via ribbon cable: Follow the instructions at raspberrypi.org to connect and test the camera. There are guides on YouTube ( example ) if you need help working out how to insert the ribbon cable. Confirm the presence of /dev/video0 . Edit docker-compose.yml and uncomment all of the commented-out lines in the following: devices: # - /dev/video0:/dev/video0 environment: # - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true # - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y # - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 Note: The device path on the right hand side of the CAMERA_DEV environment variable corresponds with the right hand side (ie after the colon) of the device mapping. There should be no reason to change either. The three environment variables are required: environment: - ENABLE_MJPG_STREAMER=true - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 640x480 -f 10 -y - CAMERA_DEV=/dev/video0 The \"640x480\" MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT settings will probably result in your camera feed being \"letterboxed\" but they will get you started. A full list of options is at mjpg-streamer-configuration-options . The typical specs for a baseline Raspberry Pi camera are: 1080p 720p 5Mp Webcam Max resolution: 2592x1944 Max frame rate: VGA 90fps, 1080p 30fps CODEC: MJPG H.264 AVC For that type of camera, the following is probably more appropriate: - MJPG_STREAMER_INPUT=-r 1152x648 -f 10 The resolution of 1152x648 is 60% of 1080p 1920x1080 and does not cause letterboxing. The resolution and rate of 10 frames per second won't over-tax your communications links, and the camera is MJPEG-capable so it does not need the -y option. Practical usage starting the OctoPrint container To start a print session: Turn the 3D printer on. Bring up the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d octoprint If you try to start the OctoPrint container before your 3D printer has been switched on and the USB interface has registered with the Raspberry Pi, the container will go into a restart loop. first run \u2013 the Setup Wizard Use a browser to point to port 9980 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:9980 This will launch the \"Setup Wizard\". Click the \"Next\" button until you reach the \"Access Control\" screen: Define a Username and Password, and keep a record of your decisions. Click \"Create Account\". Ignore the alarming popup alert by clicking \"Ignore\". This alert is a result of OctoPrint running in a Docker container. Click \"Next\". At the \"Online Connectivity Check\" screen: Click \"Disable Connectivity Check\". Click \"Next\". At the \"Configure Anonymous Usage Tracking\" and \"Configure plugin blacklist processing\" screens: Make a decision about whether you want the feature enabled or disabled and click the appropriate button. Click \"Next\". At the \"Set up your printer profile\" screen: It is probably a good idea to visit the tabs and set values appropriate to your printer (build volume, at least). Click \"Next\". At the \"Server Commands\" screen: Enter the following in the \"Restart OctoPrint\" field: s6-svc -r /var/run/s6/services/octoprint Click \"Next\". At the \"Webcam & Timelapse Recordings\" screen, and assuming you are configuring a PiCamera: Enter the following in the \"Stream URL\" field: /webcam/?action=stream Click the \"Test\" button to confirm that the camera is working, then click \"Close\". Enter the following in the \"Snapshot URL\" field: http://localhost:8080/?action=snapshot Click the \"Test\" button to confirm that the camera is working, then click \"Close\". Enter the following in the \"Path to FFMPEG\" field: /usr/bin/ffmpeg The expected result is the message \"The path is valid\". Click \"Next\". Click \"Finish\" then click the button to reload the user interface. after the first run Use a browser to point to port 9980 on your Raspberry Pi. For example: http://raspberrypi.local:9980 Supply your user credentials and login. popup messages OctoPrint will display numerous messages in popup windows. These generally fall into two categories: Messages that refer to updates; and Messages that refer to other events. In general, you can ignore messages about updates. You will get all updates automatically the next time the octoprint-docker container is rebuilt and pushed to DockerHub. You can, if you wish, allow an update to proceed. It might be appropriate to do that if you want to test an update. Just be aware that: Updates are ephemeral and will disappear the next time the Octoprint container is created. Updates can change the structure of the persistent storage area in a way which can't be undone, and which may prevent the Octoprint container from starting the next time it is created. In other words, if you want to trial an update, take a backup of OctoPrint's persistent storage area first . restarting the OctoPrint container You can restart the OctoPrint service in two ways: via the Raspberry Pi command line; or via the OctoPrint user interface. Whichever method you choose will result in a refresh of the OctoPrint user interface and you will need to follow the prompts to reload your browser page. restarting via the command line Run the following commands: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart octoprint restarting via OctoPrint user interface From the \"System\" icon in the OctoPrint toolbar (looks like a power button symbol): Choose \"Restart OctoPrint\". Note: If you do not see the \"System\" icon in the toolbar, fix it line this: Click the \"Settings\" icon (looks like a wrench) in the OctoPrint toolbar. Choose \"Server\". Enter the following into the \"Restart OctoPrint\" field: s6-svc -r /var/run/s6/services/octoprint Click \"Save\". stopping the OctoPrint container Unless you intend to leave your printer switched on 24 hours a day, you will also need to be careful when you switch off the printer: Terminate the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint Turn the 3D printer off. If you turn the printer off without terminating the container, you will crash the container. Video feed (built-in camera interface) You can view the video feed independently of the OctoPrint web interface like this: http://raspberrypi.local:9980/webcam/?action=stream Silencing the security warning OctoPrint assumes it is running \"natively\" rather than in a container. From a data-communications perspective, OctoPrint (the process running inside the OctoPrint container) sees itself as running on a computer attached to the internal Docker network. When you connect to OctoPrint's web interface from a client device attached to an external network, OctoPrint sees that your source IP address is not on the internal Docker network and it issues a security warning. To silence the warning: Terminate the container if it is running: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint use sudo and your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/volumes/octoprint/octoprint/config.yaml Implement the following pattern: server: \u2026 ipCheck: enabled: true trustedSubnets: - 203.0.132.0/24 Notes: The server: , ipCheck: and enabled: directives may already be in place but the trustedSubnets: directive may not be. Add it, and then add your local subnet(s) where you see the \"192.168.1.0/24\" example. Remember to use spaces in YAML files. Do not use tabs. Save the file. Bring up the container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d octoprint Routine container maintenance You can check for updates like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull octoprint $ docker-compose up -d octoprint $ docker system prune If you forget your username and password You can view a list of usernames like this: $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user list To reset a user's password: Use the following line as a template and replace \u00abusername\u00bb and \u00abpassword\u00bb with appropriate values: docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user password --password \u00abpassword\u00bb \u00abusername\u00bb Execute the edited command. For example, to set the password for user \"me\" to \"verySecure\": $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user password --password verySecure me Restart OctoPrint: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart octoprint Note: OctoPrint supports more than one username. To explore the further: $ docker exec octoprint octoprint --basedir /octoprint/octoprint user --help If all else fails\u2026 If the OctoPrint container seems to be misbehaving, you can get a \"clean slate\" by: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop octoprint $ docker-compose rm -f octoprint $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/octoprint $ docker-compose up -d octoprint The OctoPrint container is well-behaved and will re-initialise its persistent storage area correctly. OctoPrint will adopt \"first run\" behaviour and display the Setup Wizard.","title":"OctoPrint \u2013 the snappy web interface for your 3D printer"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#octoprint-the-snappy-web-interface-for-your-3d-printer","text":"","title":"OctoPrint \u2013 the snappy web interface for your 3D printer"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#references","text":"OctoPrint home page OctoPrint Community Forum DockerHub octoprint/octoprint GitHub OctoPrint/octoprint-docker","title":"References"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#device-mappings","text":"When you select \"OctoPrint\" in the IOTstack menu, the service definition in your docker-compose.yml , contains the following under the devices: heading: devices: - /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 # - /dev/video0:/dev/video0","title":"Device mappings"},{"location":"Containers/Octoprint/#the-devttyama0devttyacm0-mapping","text":"The /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyACM0 mapping should be read as saying \"the physical Raspberry Pi device /dev/ttyAMA0 is mapped to the logical OctoPrint container device /dev/ttyACM0 \".

If you bring up your container like that, the mapping will succeed and the container is unlikely to go into a restart loop. However, the OctoPrint container is unlikely to be able to connect to your 3D printer via /dev/ttyAMA0 for the very simple reason that that is not how 3D printers usually appear on the Raspberry Pi.

It is a successor to Portainer . According to the Portainer CE documentation Portainer 1.24.x will continue as a separate code branch, released as portainer/portainer:latest, and will receive ongoing security updates until at least 1st Sept 2021. No new features will be added beyond what was available in 1.24.1. From that it should be clear that Portainer is deprecated and that Portainer CE is the way forward. Portainer CE coexistence with Portainer IOTstack has been set up so that Portainer CE and Portainer can coexist. This is intended as a short-term migration aid rather than a long-term proposition. If you are a first-time user of IOTstack, you should choose Portainer CE and forget about Portainer . Installing Portainer CE Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose \"Build Stack\", select \"Portainer-ce\", press [TAB] then \"\\<Ok>\" and follow through to the end of the menu process, typically choosing \"Do not overwrite\" for any existing services. When the menu finishes: $ docker-compose up -d Ignore any message like this: WARNING: Found orphan containers (portainer) for this project \u2026 Migration note Portainer CE and Portainer use different locations for their persistent data: Edition Persistent Data Directory Reference Portainer ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer [A] Portainer CE ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer-ce [B] If you have been running Portainer but have never run Portainer CE then: [A] will exist, but [B] will not exist. Whenever \"Portainer-ce\" is enabled in menu.sh , a check is made for the presence of [A] combined with the absence [B]. If and only if that situation exists, [B] is initialised as a copy of [A]. This one-time copy is intended to preserve your Portainer settings and admin user password for use in Portainer CE . Thereafter, any settings you change in Portainer CE will not be reflected in Portainer , nor vice versa. Port Number = 9002 Both Portainer CE and Portainer are usually configured to listen to port 9000 but, in the IOTstack implementation: Portainer CE uses port 9002; and Portainer uses port 9000. You can always change the port numbers in your docker-compose.yml . First run of Portainer CE In your web browser navigate to #yourip:9002/ . If you are migrating from Portainer : review the Migration note which explains why your Portainer credentials will likely apply to Portainer CE , and then supply your Portainer credentials. If you are not migrating from Portainer : the first screen will suggest a username of \"admin\" and ask for a password. Supply those credentials and click \"Create User\". the second screen will ask you to select a connection method. For IOTstack, \"Docker (Manage the local Docker environment)\" is usually appropriate so click that and then click \"Connect\". From there, you can click on the \"Local\" group and take a look around. One of the things Portainer CE can help you do is find unused containers but beware of reading too much into this because, sometimes, an \"unused\" container is actually the base for another container (eg Node-Red). There are 'Quick actions' to view logs and other stats. This can all be done from terminal commands but Portainer CE makes it easier. Ceasing use of Portainer As soon as you are happy that Portainer CE meets your needs, you can dispense with Portainer . IOTstack only has limited support for getting rid of unwanted services so you should do the following. Stop Portainer from running and remove its image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop portainer $ docker-compose rm -f portainer $ docker rmi portainer/portainer Either: run menu.sh choose \"Build Stack\" de-select \"portainer\", and follow through to the end choosing \"Do not overwrite\" for existing services, or: edit docker-compose.yml and remove these lines: portainer: container_name: portainer image: portainer/portainer restart: unless-stopped ports: - \"9000:9000\" volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - ./volumes/portainer/data:/data edit services/selection.txt and remove this line: portainer Tidy-up: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ rm -rf ./services/portainer $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/portainer Setting the Public IP address for your end-point If you click on a \"Published Port\" in the \"Containers\" list, your browser may return an error saying something like \"can't connect to server\" associated with an IP address of \"0.0.0.0\". To fix that problem, proceed as shown below: Click \"Endpoints\" in the left hand panel. Click the name \"local\" in the list of Endpoints. Click in the \"Public IP\" field. Enter one of the following: The multicast DNS (MDNS) name of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.local ) The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.mydomain.com ) The IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg 192.168.1.10 ) Click \"Update endpoint\". To remove the Public IP address, repeat the above steps but clear the \"Public IP\" field in step 3. The reason why you have to tell Portainer CE which Public IP address to use is because an instance of Portainer CE does not necessarily have to be running on the same Raspberry Pi as the Docker containers it is managing. Keep in mind that clicking on a \"Published Port\" does not guarantee that your browser can open a connection. For example: Port 1883 for Mosquitto expects MQTT packets. It will not respond to HTTP, so any attempt will fail. Port 8089 for PiHole will respond to HTTP but PiHole may reject or mis-handle your attempt. Port 1880 for NodeRed will respond normally. All things considered, you will get more consistent behaviour if you simply bookmark the URLs you want to use for your IOTstack services. If you forget your password If you forget the password you created for Portainer CE , you can recover by doing the following: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop portainer-ce $ sudo rm -r ./volumes/portainer-ce $ docker-compose start portainer-ce Then use your browser to navigate to #yourip:9002/ and follow the steps in if you are not migrating from Portainer .","title":"Portainer CE"},{"location":"Containers/Portainer-ce/#portainer-ce","text":"","title":"Portainer CE"},{"location":"Containers/Portainer-ce/#references","text":"Docker Website","title":"References"},{"location":"Containers/Portainer-ce/#definition","text":"\"#yourip\" means any of the following: the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg 192.168.1.10 ) the multicast domain name of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.local ) the domain name of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.mydomain.com )","title":"Definition"},{"location":"Containers/Portainer-ce/#about-portainer-ce","text":"Portainer CE (Community Edition) is an application for managing Docker.

How Telegraf gets built for IOTstack Telegraf images ( DockerHub ) Periodically, the source code is recompiled and the resulting image is pushed to influxdata Telegraf on DockerHub . IOTstack menu When you select Telegraf in the IOTstack menu, the template service definition is copied into the Compose file. Under old menu, it is also copied to the working service definition and then not really used. IOTstack first run On a first install of IOTstack, you run the menu, choose your containers, and are told to do this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d See also the Migration considerations (below). docker-compose reads the Compose file. When it arrives at the telegraf fragment, it finds: telegraf: container_name: telegraf build: ./.templates/telegraf/. \u2026 The build statement tells docker-compose to look for: ~/IOTstack/.templates/telegraf/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is in the .templates directory because it is intended to be a common build for all IOTstack users. This is different to the arrangement for Node-RED where the Dockerfile is in the services directory because it is how each individual IOTstack user's version of Node-RED is customised. The Dockerfile begins with: FROM telegraf:latest If you need to pin to a particular version of Telegraf, the Dockerfile is the place to do it. See Telegraf version pinning . The FROM statement tells the build process to pull down the base image from DockerHub . It is a base image in the sense that it never actually runs as a container on your Raspberry Pi. The remaining instructions in the Dockerfile customise the base image to produce a local image . The customisations are: Add the rsync package. This helps the container perform self-repair. Make a backup copy of the default telegraf.conf . The backup is used to re-create the working copy if that ever gets removed from the persistent storage area. Replace entrypoint.sh with a version which: calls rsync to perform self-repair if telegraf.conf goes missing; and enforces root:root ownership in ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf . The local image is instantiated to become your running container. When you run the docker images command after Telegraf has been built, you will see two rows for Telegraf: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_telegraf latest 59861b7fe9ed 2 hours ago 292MB telegraf latest a721ac170fad 3 days ago 273MB telegraf is the base image ; and iotstack_telegraf is the local image . You will see the same pattern in Portainer , which reports the base image as \"unused\". You should not remove the base image, even though it appears to be unused. Migration considerations Under the original IOTstack implementation of Telegraf (just \"as it comes\" from DockerHub ), the service definition expected telegraf.conf to be at: ~/IOTstack/services/telegraf/telegraf.conf Under this implementation of Telegraf, the configuration file has moved to: ~/IOTstack/volumes/telegraf/telegraf.conf The change of location is one of the things that allows self-repair to work properly. The default version the configuration file supplied with earlier versions of IOTstack only contained 237 lines. At the time of writing (August 2021), the default version supplied with the Telegraf image downloaded from DockerHub contains 8641 lines. That is a significant difference. It is not clear why the version supplied with the original gcgarner/IOTstack was so short. Nevertheless, that file was inherited by SensorsIot/IOTstack and has never been changed. If you did not need to alter the 237-line file when you were running the original IOTstack implementation of Telegraf, it is readonably likely that the 8641-line default will also work, and that there will be no change in Telegraf's behaviour when it is built from a Dockerfile . However, if you experience problems then you have two choices: Use your old telegraf.conf : $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose rm --force --stop -v telegraf $ sudo cp ./services/telegraf/telegraf.conf ./volumes/telegraf/telegraf.conf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf Work out which options you need to change in the 8641-line version. You can use your favourite Unix text editor. To cause Telegraf to notice your changes: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart telegraf Logging You can inspect Telegraf's log by: $ docker logs telegraf These logs are ephemeral and will disappear when your Telegraf container is rebuilt. Upgrading Telegraf You can update most containers like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d $ docker system prune In words: docker-compose pull downloads any newer images; docker-compose up -d causes any newly-downloaded images to be instantiated as containers (replacing the old containers); and the prune gets rid of the outdated images. This strategy doesn't work when a Dockerfile is used to build a local image on top of a base image downloaded from DockerHub . The local image is what is running so there is no way for the pull to sense when a newer version becomes available. The only way to know when an update to Telegraf is available is to check the Telegraf tags page on DockerHub . Once a new version appears on DockerHub , you can upgrade Telegraf like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose build --no-cache --pull telegraf $ docker-compose up -d telegraf $ docker system prune $ docker system prune Breaking it down into parts: build causes the named container to be rebuilt; --no-cache tells the Dockerfile process that it must not take any shortcuts. It really must rebuild the local image ; --pull tells the Dockerfile process to actually check with DockerHub to see if there is a later version of the base image and, if so, to download it before starting the build; telegraf is the named container argument required by the build command. Your existing Telegraf container continues to run while the rebuild proceeds. Once the freshly-built local image is ready, the up tells docker-compose to do a new-for-old swap. There is barely any downtime for your service. The prune is the simplest way of cleaning up. The first call removes the old local image . The second call cleans up the old base image . Telegraf version pinning If you need to pin Telegraf to a particular version: Use your favourite text editor to open the following file: ~/IOTstack/.templates/telegraf/Dockerfile Find the line: FROM telegraf:latest Replace latest with the version you wish to pin to. For example, to pin to version 1.19.3: FROM telegraf:1.19.3 Save the file and tell docker-compose to rebuild the local image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d --build telegraf $ docker system prune The new local image is built, then the new container is instantiated based on that image. The prune deletes the old local image . Note: As well as preventing Docker from updating the base image , pinning will also block incoming updates to the Dockerfile from a git pull . Nothing will change until you decide to remove the pin.","title":"Telegraf"},{"location":"Containers/Telegraf/#telegraf","text":"This document discusses an IOTstack-specific version of Telegraf built on top of influxdata/influxdata-docker/telegraf using a Dockerfile .

It can securely connect you to your home network, allowing you to access your home network's local services from anywhere. It can also secure your traffic when using public internet connections. Reference: WireGuard home page Assumptions: These instructions assume that you have privileges to configure your network's gateway (router). If you are not able to make changes to your network's firewall settings, then you will not be able to finish this setup. In common with most VPN technologies, WireGuard assumes that the WAN side of your network's gateway has a public IP address which is reachable directly. WireGuard may not work if that assumption does not hold. If you strike this problem, you have to take it up with your ISP. Installing WireGuard under IOTstack You increase your chances of a trouble-free installation by performing the installation steps in the following order. Step 1: Update your Raspberry Pi OS To be able to run WireGuard successfully, your Raspberry Pi needs to be fully up-to-date. If you want to understand why, see the read only flag . $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade -y Step 2: Set up a Dynamic DNS name Before you can use WireGuard (or any VPN solution), you need a mechanism for your remote clients to reach your home router. You have two choices: Obtain a permanent IP address for your home router from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Approach your ISP if you wish to pursue this option. It generally involves additional charges. Use a Dynamic DNS service. See IOTstack documentation Accessing your device from the internet . The rest of this documentation assumes you have chosen this option. Step 3: Understand the Service Definition This is the service definition template that IOTstack uses for WireGuard: wireguard: container_name: wireguard image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/wireguard restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Etc/UTC - SERVERURL=your.dynamic.dns.name - SERVERPORT=51820 - PEERS=laptop,phone,tablet - PEERDNS=auto - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 ports: - \"51820:51820/udp\" volumes: - ./volumes/wireguard:/config - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro cap_add: - NET_ADMIN - SYS_MODULE sysctls: - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 Unfortunately, that service definition will not work \"as is\". It needs to be configured. Key points: Everything in the environment: section from SERVERURL= down to PEERDNS= (inclusive) affects WireGuard's generated configurations (the QR codes). In other words, any time you change any of those values, any existing QR codes will stop working. WireGuard does not need to communicate directly with other Docker containers so there is no need for it to join iotstack_nw . Step 4: Decide what to configure With most containers, you can continue to tweak environment variables and settings without upsetting the container's basic behaviour. WireGuard is a little different. You really need to think, carefully, about how you want to configure the service before you start. If you change your mind later, you generally have to start from a clean slate . Fields that you should always configure TZ= should be set to your local timezone. Example: - TZ=Australia/Sydney Note: Never use quote marks around the right hand side of a time-zone definition. SERVERURL= should be set to the domain name you have registered with a Dynamic DNS service provider. Example: - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org PEERS= should be a comma-separated list of your client devices (all the phones, tablets, laptops, desktops you want to use remotely to get back into your home network). Example: - PEERS=jill-macbook,jack-chromebook,alex-nokia-g10 Note: Many examples on the web use \"PEERS=n\" where \"n\" is a number. In practice, that approach seems to be a little fragile and is not recommended for IOTstack. Optional configuration - DNS resolution for peers PEERDNS= . The default value of auto instructs the WireGuard container to use the same DNS as other containers when resolving requests from connected peers. In practice, that means the container directs queries to 127.0.0.11, which Docker intercepts and forwards to whichever resolvers are specified in the Raspberry Pi's /etc/resolv.conf . If you have a local upstream DNS server, you can change this setting so that queries are directed to that server. For example: - PEERDNS=192.168.203.65 Optional configuration - WireGuard ports The WireGuard service definition template follows the convention of using UDP port \"51820\" in three places. You can leave it like that and it will just work. There is no reason to change the defaults unless you want to. To understand what each port number does, it is better to think of them like this: environment: - SERVERPORT=\u00abpublic\u00bb ports: - \"\u00abexternal\u00bb:\u00abinternal\u00bb/udp\" These definitions are going to be used throughout this documentation: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port is the port number that your remote WireGuard clients (phone, laptop etc) will try to reach. This is the port number that your router needs to expose to the outside world. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is the port number that Docker, running on your Raspberry Pi, will be listening on. Your router needs to forward WireGuard incoming traffic to the \u00abexternal\u00bb port on your Raspberry Pi. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is the port number that WireGuard (the server process) will be listening on inside the WireGuard container. Docker handles forwarding between the \u00abexternal\u00bb and \u00abinternal\u00bb port. Rule #1: You can change the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports but you can't change the \u00abinternal\u00bb port unless you are prepared to do a lot more work. Rule #2: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port forms part of the QR codes. If you decide to change the \u00abpublic\u00bb port after you generate the QR codes, you will have to start over from a clean slate . Rule #3: Your router needs to know about both the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports so, if you decide to change either of those, you must also reconfigure your router. See Understanding WireGuard's port numbers if you want more information on how the various port numbers are used. Step 5: Configure WireGuard There are two approaches: Let the menu generate a docker-compose.yml with the default WireGuard service definition template, and then edit docker-compose.yml . Prepare a compose-override.yml file, then run the menu and have it perform the substitutions for you. Of the two, the first is generally the simpler and means you don't have to re-run the menu whenever you want to change WireGuard's configuration. Method 1: Configure WireGuard by editing docker-compose.yml Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose the \"Build Stack\" option. If WireGuard is not already selected, select it. Press enter to begin the build. Choose Exit. Open docker-compose.yml in your favourite text editor. Navigate to the WireGuard service definition. Implement the decisions you took in decide what to configure . Save your work. Method 2: Configure WireGuard using compose-override.yml The Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack page describes how to use an override file to allow the menu to incorporate your custom configurations into the final docker-compose.yml file. You will need to create the compose-override.yml before running the menu to build your stack. If you have already built your stack, you'll have to rebuild it after creating compose-override.yml . Use your favourite text editor to create (or open) the override file. The file is expected to be at the path: ~/IOTstack/compose-override.yml Define overrides to implement the decisions you took in Decide what to configure . For example: services: wireguard: environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Australia/Sydney - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org - SERVERPORT=51820 - PEERS=laptop,phone,tablet - PEERDNS=auto - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 Key points: The override file works at the section level. Therefore, you have to include all of the environment variables from the template, not just the ones you want to alter. If your override file contains configurations for other containers, make sure the file only has a single services: directive at the start. Save your work. Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose the \"Build Stack\" option. If WireGuard is not already selected, select it. Press enter to begin the build. Choose Exit. Check your work by running: $ cat docker-compose.yml and verify that the wireguard service definition is as you expect. Step 6: Start WireGuard To start WireGuard, bring up your stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Confirm that WireGuard has started properly by running: $ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.RunningFor}}\\t{{.Status}}\" --filter name = wireguard Repeat the command a few times with a short delay in between. You are looking for signs that the WireGuard container is restarting. If the container seems to be restarting then this command is your friend: $ docker logs wireguard See also discussion of the read-only flag . Confirm that WireGuard has generated the expected configurations. For example, given the following setting in docker-compose.yml : - PEERS=jill-macbook,jack-chromebook,alex-nokia-g10 you would expect a result something like this: $ tree ./volumes/wireguard volumes/wireguard/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 coredns \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Corefile \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom-cont-init.d \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom-services.d \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jack-chromebook.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_jack-chromebook \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_jack-chromebook \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_jill-macbook.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_jill-macbook \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_jill-macbook \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10.conf \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer_alex-nokia-g10.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-peer_alex-nokia-g10 \u251c\u2500\u2500 server \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 privatekey-server \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 publickey-server \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 peer.conf \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.conf \u2514\u2500\u2500 wg0.conf Notice how each element in the PEERS= list is represented by a sub-directory prefixed with peer_ . You should expect the same pattern for your peers. Step 7: Save your WireGuard client configuration files (QR codes) The first time you launch WireGuard, it generates cryptographically protected configurations for your remote clients and encapsulates those configurations in QR codes. You can see the QR codes by running: $ docker logs wireguard WireGuard's log is ephemeral, which means it resets each time the container is re-created. In other words, you can't rely on going back to the log to obtain your QR codes if you lose them. WireGuard also records the QR codes as .png files. In fact, the QR codes shown by docker logs wireguard are just side-effects of the .png files as they are created. If your Raspberry Pi has a GUI (such as a screen attached to an HDMI port or a VNC connection), you can always retrieve the QR codes by opening the .png files in the GUI. If, however, your Raspberry Pi is running headless, you will need to copy the .png files to a system that is capable of displaying them, such as a Mac or PC. You can use SCP to do that. See ssh tutorial if you need help setting up SSH (of which SCP is a part). For example, to copy all PNG files from your Raspberry Pi to a target system: $ find ~/IOTstack/volumes/wireguard -name \"*.png\" -exec scp {} user@hostorip:. \\; Note: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the GUI-capable target computer; and user is a valid username on the target computer. If you want to work in the other direction (ie from the GUI-capable system), you can try: $ scp pi@hostorip:IOTstack/volumes/wireguard/peer_jill-macbook/peer_jill-macbook.png . In this case: hostorip is the host name, fully-qualified domain name, multicast domain name or IP address of the Raspberry Pi that is running WireGuard. Keep in mind that each QR code contains everything needed for any device to access your home network via WireGuard. Treat your .png files as \"sensitive documents\". Step 8: Configure your router with a NAT rule A typical home network will have a firewall that effectively blocks all incoming attempts from the Internet to open a new connection with a device on your network. To use a VPN from outside of your home network (which is precisely the point of running the service!), you need to configure your router to allow incoming WireGuard traffic to reach the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. These instructions assume you have the privileges to do that. If you have not used your router's administrative interface before, the default login credentials may be physically printed on the device or in its instruction manual. If you have never changed the default login credentials, you should take the time to do that. Routers have wildly different user interfaces but the concepts will be the same. This section describes the basic technique but if you are unsure how to do this on your particular router model, the best idea would be to search the web for: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] port forwarding configuration\"; or \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] NAT configuration\" A typical configuration process goes something like this: The router sub-process you need to configure is called Network Address Translation (NAT) but it's not unheard of for this functionality to be grouped with FireWall. The NAT component you are looking for probably has a name like \"Port Redirection\", \"Port Forwarding\", \"NAT Forwarding\" or \"NAT Virtual Server\". It might also be under \"Open Ports\" but those are usually one-to-one mappings (ie incomingPort=outgoingPort), apply to port ranges, and are intended to target a single DMZ host. The configuration screen will contain at least the following fields: Field Value Interface router's WAN interface Private IP x.x.x.x Private Port \u00abexternal\u00bb Protocol UDP Public Port \u00abpublic\u00bb Service Name WireGuard The fields in the above list are in alphabetical order. They will almost certainly be in a different order in your router and may also have different names: Interface is typically a popup menu. Generally it will either default to the name of the physical port on your router that connects to the outside world, or be some other sensible default like \"All\". Private IP (or Internal IP ) is the IP address of the Raspberry Pi running WireGuard. Note that this pretty much forces you to give your Raspberry Pi a statically-configured IP address (either a static binding in your DHCP server or a hard-coded address in the Raspberry Pi itself). Private Port (or Internal Port ) needs to be the value you chose for \u00abexternal\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Yes, this does sound counterintuitive but it's a matter of perspective. From the router's perspective, the port is on the private or internal part of your home network. From Docker's perspective, the port is \u00abexternal\u00bb to container-space. Protocol will usually default to \"TCP\" but you must change it to \"UDP\". Public Port or External Port needs to be the value you chose for \u00abpublic\u00bb in the WireGuard service definition (51820 if you didn't change it). Service Name (or Service Type ) is typically a text field, an editable menu (where you can either make a choice or type your own value), or a button approximating an editable menu. If you are given the option of choosing \"WireGuard\", do that, otherwise just type that name into the field. It has no significance other than reminding you what the rule is for. Step 9: Configure your remote WireGuard clients This is a massive topic and one which is well beyond the scope of this guide. You really will have to work it out for yourself. Start by Googling: \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] install WireGuard client\". You will find the list of client software at WireGuard Installation . For portable devices (eg iOS and Android) it usually boils down to: Install the app on your portable device. Display the QR code the WireGuard server generated for the device. Launch the app. Point the device's camera at the QR code. Follow your nose. Understanding WireGuard's port numbers Here's a concrete example configuration using three different port numbers: environment: - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org - SERVERPORT=51620 ports: - \"51720:51820/udp\" In other words: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port is 51620. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is 51720. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is 51820. You also need to make a few assumptions: The host running the remote WireGuard client (eg a mobile phone with the WireGuard app installed) has been allocated the IP address 55.66.77.88 when it connected to the Internet over 3G/4G/5G. When the remote WireGuard client initiated the session, it chose UDP port 44524 as its source port. The actual number chosen is (essentially) random and only significant to the client. Your Internet Service Provider allocated the IP address 12.13.14.15 to the WAN side of your router. You have done all the steps in [Set up a Dynamic DNS name] and your WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) is being propagated to your Dynamic DNS service provider. Here's a reference model to help explain what occurs: The remote WireGuard client: Obtains the Dynamic DNS domain name (\"downunda.duckdns.org\") and \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) from the configuration contained within the QR code. Recall that those values are obtained from the SERVERURL= and SERVERPORT= environment variables in docker-compose.yml . Executes a DNS query for the domain name \"downunda.duckdns.org\" to obtains the WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) of your home router. Addresses outgoing packets to 12.13.14.15:51620. You configure a NAT port-forwarding rule in your router which accepts incoming traffic on the \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) and uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the Raspberry Pi and destination port to the \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port (51720). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 192.168.203.60:51720. Docker is listening to the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port 51720. Docker uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the WireGuard container and destination port to the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 172.18.0.6:51820. The packet is then routed to the internal bridged network, and delivered to the WireGuard server process running in the container which is listening on the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). A reciprocal process occurs when the WireGuard server process sends packets back to the remote WireGuard client. The following table summarises the transformations as the client and server exchange information: Even if you use port 51820 everywhere (the default), all this Network Address Translation still occurs. Keep this in mind if you are trying to debug WireGuard because you may actually find it simpler to understand what is going on if you use different numbers for the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports. This model is a slight simplification because the remote client may also be also operating behind a router performing Network Address Translation. It is just easier to understand the basic concepts if you assume the remote client has a publicly-routable IP address. Debugging techniques Monitor WireGuard traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi If tcpdump is not installed on your Raspberry Pi, you can install it by: $ sudo apt install tcpdump After that, you can capture traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi by: $ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n udp port \u00abexternal\u00bb Press ctrl c to terminate the capture. Monitor WireGuard traffic between your Raspberry Pi and the WireGuard container First, you need to add tcpdump to the container. You only need to do this once per debugging session. The package will remain in place until the next time you re-create the container. $ docker exec wireguard bash -c 'apt update ; apt install -y tcpdump' To monitor traffic: $ docker exec wireguard tcpdump -i eth0 -n udp port \u00abinternal\u00bb Press ctrl c to terminate the capture. Is Docker listening on the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb port? $ PORT = \u00abexternal\u00bb ; sudo nmap -sU -p $PORT 127 .0.0.1 | grep \" $PORT /udp\" There will be a short delay. The expected answer is either: \u00abexternal\u00bb/udp open|filtered unknown = Docker is listening \u00abexternal\u00bb/udp closed unknown = Docker is not listening Success implies that the container is also listening. Is your router listening on the \u00abpublic\u00bb port? $ PORT = \u00abpublic\u00bb ; sudo nmap -sU -p $PORT downunda.duckdns.org | grep \" $PORT /udp\" There will be a short delay. The expected answer is either: \u00abpublic\u00bb/udp open|filtered unknown = Docker is listening \u00abpublic\u00bb/udp closed unknown = Docker is not listening The read-only flag The :ro at the end of the following line in WireGuard's service definition means \"read only\": - /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro If that flag is omitted then WireGuard may try to update the /lib/modules path in your operating system. To be clear, /lib/modules is both outside the WireGuard container and outside the normal persistent storage area in the ./volumes directory. The basic idea of containers is that processes are contained , include all their own dependencies, can be added and removed cleanly, and don't change the underlying operating system. Writing into /lib/modules is not needed on a Raspberry Pi, providing that Raspberry Pi OS is up-to-date. That is why the first step in the installation procedure tells you to bring the system up-to-date. If WireGuard refuses to install and you have good reason to suspect that WireGuard may be trying to write to /lib/modules then you can consider removing the :ro flag and re-trying. Just be aware that WireGuard will likely be modifying your operating system. Updating WireGuard To update the WireGuard container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull wireguard If a new image comes down, then: $ docker-compose up -d wireguard $ docker system prune Getting a clean slate If WireGuard misbehaves, you can start over from a clean slate. You also need to do this if you change any of the following environment variables: - SERVERURL= - SERVERPORT= - PEERS= - PEERDNS= The procedure is: If WireGuard is running, terminate it: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop wireguard $ docker-compose rm -f wireguard Erase the persistent storage area (essential): $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/wireguard Be very careful with that command and double-check your work before you hit return . Erasing the persistent storage area destroys the old client configurations and invalidates any copies of QR codes. Existing clients will stop working until presented with a new QR code. Start WireGuard: $ docker-compose up -d wireguard This will generate new client configurations and QR codes for your devices.","title":"WireGuard"},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#wireguard","text":"WireGuard is a fast, modern, secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel.

This is the port number that your router needs to expose to the outside world. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is the port number that Docker, running on your Raspberry Pi, will be listening on. Your router needs to forward WireGuard incoming traffic to the \u00abexternal\u00bb port on your Raspberry Pi. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is the port number that WireGuard (the server process) will be listening on inside the WireGuard container.

Follow your nose.","title":" Step 9: Configure your remote WireGuard clients "},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#understanding-wireguards-port-numbers","text":"Here's a concrete example configuration using three different port numbers: environment: - SERVERURL=downunda.duckdns.org - SERVERPORT=51620 ports: - \"51720:51820/udp\" In other words: The \u00abpublic\u00bb port is 51620. The \u00abexternal\u00bb port is 51720. The \u00abinternal\u00bb port is 51820. You also need to make a few assumptions: The host running the remote WireGuard client (eg a mobile phone with the WireGuard app installed) has been allocated the IP address 55.66.77.88 when it connected to the Internet over 3G/4G/5G. When the remote WireGuard client initiated the session, it chose UDP port 44524 as its source port. The actual number chosen is (essentially) random and only significant to the client. Your Internet Service Provider allocated the IP address 12.13.14.15 to the WAN side of your router. You have done all the steps in [Set up a Dynamic DNS name] and your WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) is being propagated to your Dynamic DNS service provider. Here's a reference model to help explain what occurs: The remote WireGuard client: Obtains the Dynamic DNS domain name (\"downunda.duckdns.org\") and \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) from the configuration contained within the QR code. Recall that those values are obtained from the SERVERURL= and SERVERPORT= environment variables in docker-compose.yml . Executes a DNS query for the domain name \"downunda.duckdns.org\" to obtains the WAN IP address (12.13.14.15) of your home router. Addresses outgoing packets to 12.13.14.15:51620. You configure a NAT port-forwarding rule in your router which accepts incoming traffic on the \u00abpublic\u00bb UDP port (51620) and uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the Raspberry Pi and destination port to the \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port (51720). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 192.168.203.60:51720. Docker is listening to the Raspberry Pi's \u00abexternal\u00bb UDP port 51720. Docker uses Network Address Translation to change the destination IP address to the WireGuard container and destination port to the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). In other words, each incoming packet is readdressed to 172.18.0.6:51820. The packet is then routed to the internal bridged network, and delivered to the WireGuard server process running in the container which is listening on the \u00abinternal\u00bb UDP port (51820). A reciprocal process occurs when the WireGuard server process sends packets back to the remote WireGuard client. The following table summarises the transformations as the client and server exchange information: Even if you use port 51820 everywhere (the default), all this Network Address Translation still occurs. Keep this in mind if you are trying to debug WireGuard because you may actually find it simpler to understand what is going on if you use different numbers for the \u00abpublic\u00bb and \u00abexternal\u00bb ports. This model is a slight simplification because the remote client may also be also operating behind a router performing Network Address Translation. It is just easier to understand the basic concepts if you assume the remote client has a publicly-routable IP address.","title":" Understanding WireGuard's port numbers "},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#debugging-techniques","text":"","title":" Debugging techniques "},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#monitor-wireguard-traffic-between-your-router-and-your-raspberry-pi","text":"If tcpdump is not installed on your Raspberry Pi, you can install it by: $ sudo apt install tcpdump After that, you can capture traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi by: $ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n udp port \u00abexternal\u00bb Press ctrl c to terminate the capture.","title":" Monitor WireGuard traffic between your router and your Raspberry Pi "},{"location":"Containers/WireGuard/#monitor-wireguard-traffic-between-your-raspberry-pi-and-the-wireguard-container","text":"First, you need to add tcpdump to the container.

The basic idea of containers is that processes are contained , include all their own dependencies, can be added and removed cleanly, and don't change the underlying operating system. Writing into /lib/modules is not needed on a Raspberry Pi, providing that Raspberry Pi OS is up-to-date. That is why the first step in the installation procedure tells you to bring the system up-to-date.
